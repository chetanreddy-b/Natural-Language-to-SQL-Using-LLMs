2. `COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes` - This part of the query counts the total number of rows for each group (i.e., each day of the week) and labels it as `Total_Crimes`.
3. `FROM atlanta_crime_data` - The query is executed on the `atlanta_crime_data` table.
4. `WHERE Area_Name = 'Atlanta'` - The query filters the data to return only rows where the `Area_Name` is 'Atlanta'.
5. `GROUP BY DAYNAME(Crime_Date)` - This part groups the data by the day of the week.
6. `ORDER BY FIELD(DAYNAME(Crime_Date), 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')` - This sorts the result by the day of the week in the order of Sunday to Saturday.

This SQL query selects the year, month, and count of crimes from the ""crimes"" table where the city is 'Atlanta'. It groups the results by year and month to get the total crimes occurred in Atlanta during each month of the year.

This query extracts the month from the `Crime_Date` column and counts the number of crime IDs (i.e., total crimes) for each month. Additionally, it filters the results to only include crimes that occurred in Atlanta using the WHERE clause and `[Area_Name = 'Atlanta']`. The results are then grouped by the month and returned in ascending order."," To fulfill the request, we can use a SQL query that groups the crime data by the month of the year, and then counts the number of total crimes that happened in Atlanta. Assuming the Atlanta Area_Name is specifically 'Atlanta' in the data set (though it seems not explicit in the provided data), here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes 
FROM 
  atlanta_crime_data 
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'Atlanta' 
GROUP BY 
  Month 
ORDER BY 
  Month;
```

This query selects the Crime_Date (if it has different format or null values, it may need adjustment), formats it by year and month, then counts the total events grouped by month. Finally, it orders the output by the month in ascending order.

Depending on the SQL database you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), the syntax to extract the year and month from the `Crime_Date` may vary. This example uses MySQL's `DATE_FORMAT` function to extract and format the year and month. If you use a different RDBMS, you might need to use a different function or method. For example, PostgreSQL uses `TO_CHAR`:

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(Crime_Date, 'YYYY-MM') AS Month, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes 
FROM 
  atlanta_crime_data 
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'Atlanta' 
GROUP BY

FROM 
    Crimes
WHERE

```

If the table is structured differently, you may need to adjust the column and table names in the query above."," To get the total crimes that occurred in Atlanta at each hour of the day, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the 'Crime_Time' column is in a format that SQL can extract the hour from, such as 'HH:MM:SS' or 'HH:MM' in 24-hour format.

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM Crime_Time) AS 'Hour', 
  COUNT(*) AS 'Total_Crimes'
FROM 
  atlanta_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'Atlanta'
GROUP BY 
  Hour
ORDER BY 
  Hour;
```

This query:

1. Extracts the hour part from the `Crime_Time` column using the `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM Crime_Time)` function (this function name might vary depending on the SQL dialect you are using).
2. Counts the total number of crimes for each hour using the `COUNT(*)` function.
3. Filters the crimes that occurred in the 'Atlanta' area by using the `WHERE Area_Name = 'Atlanta'` clause.
4. Groups the results by the hour of the day using the `GROUP BY Hour` clause, so that the count is calculated for each distinct hour.
5. Orders the results by the hour of the day using the `ORDER BY Hour` clause for easy reading and analysis.

Please note that the exact function to extract the hour from a datetime or timestamp column may vary depending on the specific SQL database you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). The example above uses a generic function `EXTRACT`, which is common in many databases, but you might need to adjust it according to your database system's syntax. For example, in SQL Server, you might use `DATEPART(HOUR, Crime_Time)` instead."," To fulfill the request, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT

WHERE 
    Area_Name = 'Atlanta'
GROUP BY
    DATE_PART('hour', Crime_Time)
ORDER BY
    Hour_of_Day;
```

This query will group the crimes based on the hour of the day that they occurred and count the number of crimes that occurred during each hour of the day in Atlanta. The `DATE_PART` function is used to extract the hour part from the `Crime_Time` column. The results will be ordered by the hour of the day."

In this query:

- `MONTH(Crime_Date)` and Year.
- We extract the month and year from the `Crime_Date` using the `MONTH` and `YEAR` functions.
- We count the number of crime in each month using the `COUNT` function and alias it as `Total_Crimes`.
- We only consider records where the `Area_Name` is equal to 'LA'.
- We group the results by `YEAR` and `MONTH`.
- We order the results by year and month to get the total number of crimes that happened in LA in a specific month and year.

Note that we need to switch the specific city to 'LA' assuming that it's named as such in the `Area_Name` column of the `la_crime_data` table. If LA has a different name in your database, you may have to replace `Area_Name = 'LA'` with the appropriate criteria. Additionally, if the format of the `Crime_Date` is not a date datatype, you may need to convert the `Crime_Date` before using the `MONTH` and `YEAR` functions.

This will give a result set with the `Month`, `Year` and number of crimes for each month and year within LA area."

The exact structure of this table might vary, but for the purpose of this query, let's assume there is a table named `Crimes` with the following relevant columns:

- `crime_id`: The unique identifier for each crime record.
- `city`: The city where the crime occurred.
- `timestamp`: The date and time when the crime occurred (e.g., `2023-04-01 15:30:00`).

Given this structure, you can write an SQL query to count the total number of crimes that occurred in Los Angeles at each hour of the day. Here is an example of how this SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) AS hour_of_day, -- Extracting the hour from the timestamp
    COUNT(*) AS total_crimes -- Counting the total number of crimes for each hour
FROM 
    Crimes
WHERE 
    city = 'Los Angeles' -- Filtering for only crimes that occurred in Los Angeles
GROUP BY 
    hour_of_day -- Grouping the results by the hour of the day
ORDER BY 
    hour_of_day; -- Ordering the results by the hour of the day for readability
```

This query uses the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour part of the `timestamp` field for each crime. Then, it counts the number of crimes for each hour using `COUNT(*)`, while filtering the results to include only crimes in Los Angeles. The results are grouped by the extracted hour and sorted by the hour for easier reading.

Please adjust the column names and table name (`Crimes` and `timestamp`) as needed based on the actual structure of your database."," To fulfill the request, you can write an SQL query that groups the data by the hour of the day (`Crime_Time`) and counts the number of crimes (`Crime_ID`) that occurred in LA. The following is an example query:

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM Crime_Time) AS HourOfDay,
    COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Total_Crimes
FROM
    la_crime_data
WHERE
    Area_Name = 'LA'
GROUP BY
    HourOfDay
ORDER BY
    HourOfDay;
```

This query extracts the hour from `Crime_Time` and groups the data by `HourOfDay`. It then counts the number of crimes for each hour only if the `Area_Name` is 'LA'. The results are ordered by the `HourOfDay`. 

Please note that the column names and table name are case-sensitive, and you might need to adjust them according to your actual database schema. Also, the `EXTRACT` function might vary depending on the SQL dialect you're using."," To fulfill the natural language request of finding the total crimes occurred in LA at each hour of the day, we can write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM Crime_Time) AS Hour_Of_Day,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM 
  la_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'LA'
GROUP BY
  Hour_Of_Day
ORDER BY
  Hour_Of_Day;
```
This query uses the `EXTRACT()` function to extract the hour component from the `Crime_Time` column (which is assumed to be in a time-related format). It then counts the occurrences of each hour by grouping the rows by the extracted hour value. The `WHERE` clause ensures that we only look at the crimes that occurred in the area named 'LA'.

This SQL query does the following:
- Selects the day of the week from the Crime_Date column, named as DayOfWeek.
- Counts the total number of crimes (`Crime_ID`) that occurred on each day, named as TotalCrimes.
- Filters the records to include only those from the 'New York' area (`Area_Name = 'New York'`).
- Groups the results by the day of the week.
- Orders the results correctly by the first day of the week (usually Sunday in most Western countries) using the `MIN` function combined with `DATEPART` to sort the days correctly in a week.

If you're using a database other than SQL Server, like MySQL or PostgreSQL, the function to get the day name from the date might be different (e.g., `DAYNAME()` function in MySQL or `to_char()` in PostgreSQL) and you would need to adjust the query accordingly."," To fulfill the request, we can use the following SQL query that groups the crimes by the day of the week and calculates the total count of crimes for each day:

```

This query uses the `DAYNAME()` function to retrieve the name of the weekday for each crime date, and the `DAYOFWEEK()` function to group the aggregated results by the day of the week. The `COUNT(*)` function returns the total number of crimes for each day. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only crimes that occurred in New York.

Let's assume there are two tables: `Crimes` and `Crime_Dates`.

The `Crimes` table contains information about each crime. It might look like this:
```
CREATE TABLE Crimes (
    CrimeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CrimeType VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(100)
);
```

The `Crime_Dates` table contains the dates for each crime. It might look like this:
```
CREATE TABLE Crime_Dates (
    CrimeID INT,
    Date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CrimeID) REFERENCES Crimes(CrimeID)
);
```

Given these structures, we can create an SQL query to calculate the total number of crimes that occurred in Philadelphia on each day of the week. Note that the database needs to recognize the correct day of the week for the date provided in the `Crime_Dates` table. In most SQL systems, this can be done using the `DAYOFWEEK` function.

The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 2 THEN 'Monday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 6 THEN 'Friday'
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(Date) = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
    END AS DayOfWeek,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes
FROM 
    Crime_Dates
INNER JOIN 
    Crimes
ON 
    Crime_Dates.CrimeID = Crimes.CrimeID
WHERE 
    Crimes.City = 'Philly'
GROUP BY 
    DayOfWeek;
```

This query joins the `Crimes` and `Crime_Dates` tables on the CrimeID field to find all the crimes that occurred in Philadelphia (`Crimes.City = 'Philly'`). The `CASE` statement inside the `SELECT` clause classifies each date into the corresponding day of the week. The `COUNT(*)` function then counts the number of crimes (`TotalCrimes`) that occurred on each day of the week, and the results are grouped by the day of the week (`DayOfWeek`)."," To fulfill the request, you can use the following SQL query. This query groups the crime data by day of the week and calculates the total number of crimes that occurred in Philly on each day:

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '0' THEN 'Sunday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '1' THEN 'Monday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '2' THEN 'Tuesday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '3' THEN 'Wednesday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '4' THEN 'Thursday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '5' THEN 'Friday'
    WHEN STRFTIME('%w', Crime_Date) = '6' THEN 'Saturday'
  END AS Day_of_Week,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM philly_crime_data
GROUP BY Day_of_Week
ORDER BY CASE 
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Sunday' THEN 1
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Monday' THEN 2
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Tuesday' THEN 3
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Wednesday' THEN 4
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Thursday' THEN 5
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Friday' THEN 6
    WHEN Day_of_Week = 'Saturday' THEN 7
  END
```

Note: This query uses SQLite's STRFTIME function to retrieve the day of the week as a string. Depending on your database, you may need to adapt the query to the specific date function of your system (e.g., using `DAYNAME(Crime_Date)` in MySQL)."," Too X; 49; 5800 BLOCK BROAD ST; 75.18900040; 39.98046634; 40.01470675→

Output format: date_of_weekday, total_crimes

To fulfill this request, we can write a SQL query using the `DATE_ADD` and `DATEDIFF` functions to extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` date column, and the `COUNT` function to group by each day of the week and calculate the total number of crimes:

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%W') AS date_of_weekday,
  COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM philly_crime_data
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%W')
ORDER BY DATEDIFF(Crime_Date, '2024-02-21');
```

This would give us the total number of crimes grouped by the day of the week for the specified date range. Note that the `DATE_FORMAT` function is used to format the `Crime_Date` column to return the weekday name, and the `COUNT` function is used to calculate the total number of crimes for each day. `DATEDIFF` is used to order the results by the specific weekday.

Assuming that the provided data is for only one day (February 21, 2024) as per the provided data rows, you would get the following output using the sample data provided:

date_of_weekday  | total_crimes
------------------|--------------
Monday           | 2

  COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM 
  Crimes
WHERE

```

This query groups the crime data by year and month, filters by `Philly`, and counts the number of crimes in each month. The `DATE_FORMAT` function is used to extract the year and month from the `date` column.

Please note that depending on your SQL dialect this form of `DATE_FORMAT` might be different. Here are some alternative approaches for some common SQL dialects:

* MySQL:
    * `DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m')` (as in above query)

* PostgreSQL:
    * `TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY-MM')`

* SQL Server:
    * `FORMAT(date, 'yyyy-MM')`

* Oracle:
    * `TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY-MM')`

* SQLite:
    * `strftime('%Y-%m', date)`

Please ensure that you adjust the code according to your SQL dialect and database schema requirements."," To fulfill the request, we can write an SQL query that groups the data by month and calculates the total number of crimes that occurred in each month. The SQL query would look like this:

FROM
    philly_crime_data
GROUP BY
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Crime_Date)
ORDER BY
    ""Month"";
```

This query will extract the month from the `Crime_Date` column, count the number of crimes that occurred for each month using `COUNT(*)`, and group the results by month. The output will show the total crimes for each month of the year. You can also add the `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Crime_Date)` part to differentiate between years if the data spans multiple years."," Here's an SQL query to find the total crimes occurred in Philly during each month of the year:

Assuming the Crimes started being recorded in the year 2022

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Crime_Date) AS Month, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM 
  philly_crime_data
WHERE
  Crime_Date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY
  Month
ORDER BY
  Month;
```

Explanation: The above query first filters the rows only belonging to the year 2022 and 2023 using the WHERE clause. Then, it separates the year into months using the EXTRACT function. The COUNT(*) function is then used to count the number of crimes occurred in each month. Finally, the GROUP BY clause groups the result set by Month and the ORDER BY clause orders the result set in ascending order by Month.

(Note that the date extract is case-sensitive and should be written according to your SQL dialect.)"

The SQL query below collects the total crimes that happened within each hour in Philadelphia. 

Note that here I am missing information on the time format in your database. Below query assumes it includes the hour part if your column is of type datetime or timestamp. 

```sql
SELECT 
    DATEPART(HOUR, crime_time) as hour_of_day,

FROM 
    crimes
WHERE 
    city = 'Philly'
GROUP BY 
    DATEPART(HOUR, crime_time)
ORDER BY 
    hour_of_day;
```

In this query:

1. `DATEPART(HOUR, crime_time) as hour_of_day` extracts the hour from the `crime_time` field.
2. `COUNT(crime_id) as total_crimes` counts the number of crimes in each hour.
3. The `FROM` clause specifies the table (crimes) to select data from.
4. The `WHERE` clause filters records that only occurred in Philadelphia.
5. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the selection by the extracted hour part of the `crime_time` field.
6. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result by the hour of the day.

Please adjust the query according to your table and column names and consider timezone conversions if your `crime_time` is stored in a different timezone from the one you're calculating the hour of day for.

Please be aware that this query might produce a different result depending on how you stored the time zone in your database and how accurate do you need the results to be. If you need more precise results considering local time zones, you'll need to take the time zone into account when constructing the date-time values."," To fulfill the request, we can write the following SQL query:

```

This SQL query selects the date and hour of each crime entry, counts the total number of crimes that occurred in each hourly interval, filters the results to include only Philadelphia (Philly) crimes, and groups the results by both date and hour. The results are sorted by date and hour to provide a comprehensive view of the total crimes occurring at each hour of the day in Philly."," Based on the request, you can write the following SQL query to obtain the total crimes occurred in Philly at each hour of the day:

2. An `Areas` table with columns named `area_id` that links to the `Crimes` table and `city` that identifies the city where the area belongs.

The query will join the `Crimes` table with the `Areas` table on their shared `area_id` column.

MANSLAUGHTER; QUEENS; ; "," To resolve the request, we first need to identify the structure of the relevant database containing information about crimes in New York. This is essential for writing an effective SQL query. For the purpose of this example, let's assume the following (simplified) database structure:

1. **Crimes** table: This table contains details about each crime, including a foreign key to the area where the crime occurred.
   - *crime_id* (unique identifier for each crime)
   - *crime_type* (description of the crime)
   - *area_id* (reference to the area where the crime occurred)

2. **Areas** table: This table contains information about different areas in New York.
   - *area_id* (unique identifier for each area)
   - *area_name* (name of the area)

Assuming this structure, you can use the following SQL query to find the amount of crimes in each area of New York:

```sql
SELECT
    A.area_name,
    COUNT(C.crime_id) AS crime_count
FROM
    Areas A
JOIN
    Crimes C ON A.area_id = C.area_id
GROUP BY
    A.area_name
ORDER BY
    crime_count DESC;
```

This query performs the following actions:

- Joins the `Crimes` and `Areas` tables on their common `area_id` column to combine the area information with each crime record.
- Groups the results by `area_name`, which means the query will calculate (using `COUNT`) the total number of crimes for each distinct area.
- Orders the final result in descending order of `crime_count`, so the areas with the most crimes appear first.

This query assumes that the database is using a schema similar to the simplified one described above and that the actual database names (`Crimes` and `Areas`) and column names (`crime_id`, `area_id`, `crime_type`, `area_name`) correspond to the structure described. Adjustments may be needed depending on the actual database schema."," Here is the SQL query to get the amount of crimes in each area of New York:

```sql
SELECT Area_Name, COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Crime_Count
FROM nyc_crime_data
GROUP BY Area_Name
ORDER BY Crime_Count DESC;
```

In this query:

- We use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns we want to see in the result: `Area_Name` and the count of `Crime_ID` (we alias it as `Crime_Count`).
- We use the `FROM` clause to specify the table we are querying from: `nyc_crime_data`.
- We use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows by the `Area_Name` column, allowing us to count the number of crimes per area.
- We use the `COUNT()` aggregation function to count the number of `Crime_ID` in each group (i.e., each area).
- We use the `ORDER BY` clause combined with `DESC` to sort the rows in descending order by `Crime_Count`, so the areas with the most crimes come first in the result."," Here's an SQL query that can be used to fulfill the request:

```
SELECT Area_Name, COUNT(*) AS ""Number Of Crimes""
FROM nyc_crime_data
GROUP BY Area_Name
ORDER BY ""Number Of Crimes"" DESC;
```

This query selects the Area_Name and counts the number of occurrences for each area using the COUNT() function. The GROUP BY clause is used to group the result by Area_Name. Finally, the ORDER BY clause with the DESC keyword is used to sort the results in descending order of the number of crimes, so the areas with the most crimes are displayed first.

This query will give the amount of crimes in each area of New York as requested. The result will be a list of area names along with the corresponding number of crimes, sorted in descending order of the number of crimes:

Let's assume the database table is named `philly_crimes` and it has at least two columns: `area` and `crime_id` (or something equivalent representing the number of crimes).

Assuming you want to count the total number of crimes for each area (not distinguishing by crime type), the following SQL query would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    area,
    COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM 
    philly_crimes
GROUP BY 
    area
ORDER BY 
    total_crimes DESC;
```

In this query:

- `SELECT area, COUNT(*) AS total_crimes`: selects the `area` column and counts the number of records (i.e., crimes) for each `area`. The count is given an alias `total_crimes` for clarity.
- `FROM philly_crimes`: specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
- `GROUP BY area`: groups the results by the `area` column so that the count of crimes is specific to each area.
- `ORDER BY total_crimes DESC`: orders the results by the `total_crimes` column in descending order, so the areas with the most crimes are listed first.

If you have more detailed data and you want to include information such as crime type or time when the crime happened, you could adjust the SELECT statement accordingly. For instance, if there is a `crime_type` column you want to include:

```sql
SELECT 
    area,
    crime_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM 
    philly_crimes
GROUP BY 
    area, crime_type
ORDER BY 
    total_crimes DESC;

1. Generate a list of coordinates with 0.01-degree intervals in the latitude and longitude of Atlanta.
2. Join the generated list of coordinates with the existing crime database
3. Group the result by the generated coordinates
4. For each group, find the most common crime type and its count

Here's an example SQL query that implements the above steps:

```sql

WITH latitude_ranges AS (

  AND ROUND(c.Longitude) = ROUND(cm.Longitude)
GROUP BY
  c.Latitude,
  c.Longitude,

```

In this query, we use the `generate_series` function to create a list of latitude and longitude coordinates with 0.01-degree intervals. Then, we join the generated list of coordinates with the existing crime data using the `ROUND` function to ensure that the coordinates match.

For each group of data, the query calculates the most common crime type and counts its occurrences. Finally, the result is ordered in descending order of the counts.

This query considers a 0.01-degree deviation on both sides of the Atlanta's center point for grouping results, and uses the `COUNT(*)` function to count the total number of crimes for each group. The `FLOOR()` function is used to round down the latitude and longitude to the nearest 0.01 degrees. Finally, the result set is ordered by latitude and longitude."," To fulfill the request, we can write an SQL query that uses a combination of common table expressions (CTEs) and cross joins to generate a sequence of latitudes and longitudes spaced by 0.01 degrees around Atlanta's coordinates, and then find the total crime count for each generated point.

Before starting, we need to know Atlanta's central longitude and latitude to generate a grid around it. According to several sources, Atlanta's central longitude is -84.387982 and latitude is 33.749041.

Here's the SQL query for the given schema and data:

```sql
WITH longitudes AS (
    SELECT (longitude_grid + (level - 1) * 0.01) AS grid_longitude
    FROM (
        SELECT generate_series(-84.387982, -84.377982, 0.01) AS longitude_grid
    ) t1
),
latitudes AS (
    SELECT (latitude_grid + (level - 1) * 0.01) AS grid_latitude
    FROM (
        SELECT generate_series(33.749041, 33.769041, 0.01) AS latitude_grid
    ) t2
),
coordinates AS (
    SELECT lng.grid_longitude, lat.grid_latitude
    FROM longitudes lng
    CROSS JOIN latitudes lat
),
crime_count AS (
    SELECT c.grid_longitude, c.grid_latitude, COUNT(*) AS crime_count
    FROM coordinates c
    JOIN atlanta_crime_data acd
    ON c.grid_longitude BETWEEN acd.Longitude AND acd.Longitude + 0.02
    AND c.grid_latitude BETWEEN acd.Latitude AND acd.Latitude + 0.02
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT * FROM crime_count;
```

This SQL query performs the following steps:
1. Generates a sequence of longitudes that covers all the latitude values for Atlanta, spaced by 0.01 degrees.
2. Generates a sequence of latitudes that covers all the longitude values for Atlanta, spaced by 0.01 degrees.
3. Forms a `coordinates` table using a cross join with the longitudes and latitudes lists to create all possible coordinate pairs within the generated range.
4. Counts the number of crimes for each coordinate point by joining the `crime_count` table with the `atlanta_crime_data` table, considering an additional 0.01 degrees around each point.
5. Selects the results from the crime_count table, which includes the coordinates and their corresponding crime count.

Note: The `generate_series` function is not a standard SQL function and may not be available in some relational databases. In this example, it is assumed to be available. Otherwise, you may need to find an alternative way to generate the series of longitudes and latitudes in your database. Also, the approximate 0.01-degree difference in longitude and latitude is factored into the spatial condition of the next query. This will not result in a perfect grid due to the curvature of the Earth, but it works for the purpose of this estimation."," Here is a SQL query that will fulfill the request:

```
SELECT
  FLOOR(Latitude) AS Latitude,
  FLOOR(Longitude) AS Longitude,
  COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Total_Crime_Count
FROM
  atlanta_crime_data
WHERE
  Latitude BETWEEN 33.77 AND 33.78
  AND Longitude BETWEEN -84.39 AND -84.38
GROUP BY
  FLOOR(Latitude),
  FLOOR(Longitude)
HAVING
  (Latitude % 0.01 = 0) AND (Longitude % 0.01 = 0);
```
This SQL query groups the crimes by their rounded down latitude and longitude, with each interval being 0.01 degrees square. It then counts the number of crimes for each coordinate. The WHERE clause ensures the latitude is between the approximate decimals of 33.77N and 33.78N and the longitude is between -84.39W and -84.38W, which roughly correspond to the city of Atlanta.
Note that we use FLOOR() to round down to the closest whole number of 0.01Latitude, and the HAVING clause ensures that only coordinates spaced by 0.01 degrees intervals are considered. The % operator is used to filter out the coordinate offsets that are not exactly divisible by 0.01, which is necessary because the FLOOR() function will round down to the next lowest coordinate if the latitude is not divisible. Adjust the latitude and longitude limits in the WHERE clause as necessary to fit your data."

In the above SQL query:

1. The CROSS JOIN generates a grid of all possible latitude and longitude combinations within the specified range.
2. The LEFT JOIN matches crimes within 0.01 degrees of each grid point.
3. COUNT() calculates the number of crimes for each latitude and longitude pair.
4. The final result is grouped by latitude and longitude, showing the total crime count for each coordinate.

Please note that this query assumes the ""Crimes"" table contains valid latitude and longitude values for Los Angeles within the specified range. You may need to adjust the range values according to your data."," ```sql

  COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Crime_Count

```

This query calculates and groups the latitude and longitude values by interval of 0.01 degrees as requested. Then, it counts the total crimes in each group. The `FLOOR` function is used to get the integer part of the latitude and longitude, and the `ROUND` function is used to calculate the remainder, which is then multiplied by 0.01 to get the fraction part. The `COUNT` function is used to get the total number of crimes in each group. Finally, the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the coordinate."," Here, details of various crimes reported in the area of Los Angeles, California. The 'Crime_ID' table contains a unique identifier for each record, 'Report_#' is the report number, 'Date_Reported' is the date the report was made to the police, 'Crime_Date' is the date the crime occurred, 'Crime_Time' is the time the crime occurred, 'Crime_Type' represents the type of crime, 'Area_Name' is the area where the crime occurred, 'Vict_Age' is the approximate age of the victim, 'Vict_Sex' is the gender of the victim, 'Weapon_Desc' describes any weapons used in the crime, 'Address' is the specific address where the crime happened, 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' are the geographic coordinates of the crime, 'Crime_Date' is the date of the crime,

This SQL query will group the crimes by their latitude and longitude coordinates, with each coordinate bucket representing a 0.01-degree range. The FLOOR function ensures that each crime is assigned to the specified latitude and longitude bucket.

Let's call this table `crimes`. The SQL query will group the data by latitude and longitude (rounded to 2 decimal places to account for 0.01 degrees), and then for each group, it will find the most common crime_type and its count.

Here's an example SQL query that would do this:

```sql
WITH rounded_crimes AS (
  SELECT
    ROUND(latitude, 2) AS lat,
    ROUND(longitude, 2) AS lon,
    crime_type,
    COUNT(*) AS crime_count
  FROM
    crimes
  WHERE
    latitude BETWEEN 33.75  AND 34.25
    AND longitude BETWEEN -118.70 AND -118.15
  GROUP BY
    lat, lon, crime_type
)
, ranked_crimes AS (
  SELECT
    lat,
    lon,
    crime_type,
    crime_count,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lat, lon ORDER BY crime_count DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    rounded_crimes
)
SELECT
  lat,
  lon,
  crime_type,
  crime_count
FROM
  ranked_crimes
WHERE
  rank = 1
ORDER BY
  lat,
  lon;
```

This query assumes that the `crimes` table exists with `latitude`, `longitude`, and `crime_type` columns. It first creates a derived table (`rounded_crimes`) that includes the rounded latitude and longitude and a count of crimes for each combination of latitude, longitude, and crime_type.

Then, the query defines a second derived table (`ranked_crimes`) that adds a rank based on the `crime_count`, partitioned by the rounded latitude and longitude.

Finally, the main query selects the coordinates, crime_type, and crime_count from the `ranked_crimes` table where the `rank` is 1 (indicating the most common crime). The result is ordered by latitude and longitude.

Note that this query assumes that coordinates are between 33.75° to 34.25° latitude and -118.70° to -118.15° longitude, which roughly corresponds to a specific area in Los Angeles. Adjust the latitude and longitude ranges in the `WHERE` clause if you need a different area."," Here's a sample SQL query that fulfills the natural language request. Note that the specific method of calculating the most common crime type might differ depending on the SQL implementation (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) used.

```sql
WITH
  CrimeRates AS (
    SELECT
      FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS LatGroup, -- Group LA by 0.01 degrees of latitude
      FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS LongGroup, -- Group LA by 0.01 degrees of longitude
      Crime_Type,
      COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
    FROM la_crime_data
    WHERE Area_Name = 'Los Angeles' -- Filter for LA only
    GROUP BY LatGroup, LongGroup, Crime_Type
  ),
  MaxCrimes AS (
    SELECT
      LatGroup,
      LongGroup,
      MAX(CrimeCount) AS MaxCrimeCount
    FROM CrimeRates
    GROUP BY LatGroup, LongGroup
  )
SELECT
  c.LatGroup,
  c.LongGroup,
  c.Crime_Type,
  c.CrimeCount
FROM CrimeRates c
JOIN MaxCrimes m ON c.LatGroup = m.LatGroup AND c.LongGroup = m.LongGroup AND c.CrimeCount = m.MaxCrimeCount;
```

This query consists of two common table expressions (CTEs):

1. `CrimeRates`: This CTE calculates the floor of Latitude and Longitude (multiplied by 100 to accommodate the grouping by 0.01 degrees) and groups the crime records by these latitude and longitude groups, as well as by Crime_Type. The COUNT() function totals the number of occurrences for each crime type within each group.

2. `MaxCrimes`: This CTE calculates the maximum crime count for each latitude and longitude group. It does this by grouping the crime rates by Latitude and Longitude groups.

Finally, the query selects the latitude group, longitude group, crime type, and crime count for each combination of latitude and longitude groups that have the maximum crime count. We achieve this by joining the `MaxCrimes` CTE to the `CrimeRates` CTE on Latitude and Longitude groups, and by matching the maximum crime count from `MaxCrimes` to the corresponding crime count in `CrimeRates`.

Please note that there might be multiple crime types with the same maximum count per group. The above query retrieves all those combinations. If you would like to limit the output to one entry per group, additional logic would be required to arbitrarily select one of the most common crime types (e.g., by selecting the one with the lowest alphabetical value)."," To fulfill the request, we will need to use SQL to first create ranges for latitude and longitude from each center point, and then aggregate the data to determine the most common crime type and its count within these ranges. Let's assume that our 'LA' Spaced Coordinates range from 33.0000° N to 35.0000° N for latitude, and from -120.0000° W to -119.0000° W for longitude.

SQL Query:

```SQL
SELECT 
    FLOOR(Latitude) as StartLat,
    CEIL(Latitude + 0.01) as EndLat,
    FLOOR(Longitude) as StartLon,
    CEIL(Longitude + 0.01) as EndLon,
    Crime_Type,
    COUNT(Crime_Type) as Crime_Count
FROM la_crime_data
WHERE Latitude >= 33.0000
AND Latitude < 35.01
AND Longitude >= -120.0000
AND Longitude < -118.99
GROUP BY StartLat, EndLat, StartLon, EndLon, Crime_Type
ORDER BY Crime_Count DESC;
```

In this SQL query, we create ranges for latitude and longitude using `FLOOR` and `CEIL` functions and group the data by these ranges. We then select the most common crime type and its count within each range. The `ORDER BY` clause at the end orders the results by crime count in descending order. Note that the ranges are slightly adjusted to capture the terminal points of the 0.01 degree ranges.

Please ensure that the ranges for latitude and longitude suit your requirements and adjust them accordingly if needed."

```

This query uses PostGIS, an extension to the PostgreSQL database for handling spatial data, which provides several useful functions. Here's the breakdown of the query:

1. We use `ROUND()` to round both latitude and longitude values to the nearest 0.01 degrees by subtracting the remainder when divided by 0.01.
2. The `WHERE` clause filters only the crimes that fall within New York's bounding box using the bounding box coordinates `(-73.958998, 40.763731)`.
3. We utilize PostGIS's `ST_Point`, `ST_SetSRID`, `ST_Transform`, and `ST_Dump` functions to transform the geometries from `4326` (WGS84) to `3857` (Web Mercator) and extract the bounding box geometries as polygons from the New York polygon stored in the `b` subquery.
4. Finally, we group the count by the rounded latitude and longitude values and order the result by latitude and longitude.

Note: This solution assumes that the `crimes` table has columns `latitude` and `longitude` storing the coordinates of the crimes that occurred in New York. You will need to adjust the table and column names accordingly in the query."," To fulfill the natural language request, we need to perform the following steps in our SQL query:

1. Group the NYC crime data by latitude and longitude, ensuring we use fixed-point arithmetic or a function to approximate the actual coordinates spaced every 0.01 degrees.

2. Sum the total count of crimes within each group.

Here's a sample SQL query that you might use to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT
    FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS Lat_Rounded,
    FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS Lon_Rounded,
    COUNT(*) AS Crime_Count
FROM
    nyc_crime_data
GROUP BY
    Lat_Rounded,
    Lon_Rounded
ORDER BY
    Lat_Rounded,
    Lon_Rounded;
```

In this query, the `FLOOR` function is used to divide the latitude and longitude into increments of 0.01 degrees by multiplying them by 100, rounding down to the nearest integer, and then dividing by 100 to get a rounded-down value at 0.01 degrees. The `COUNT(*)` function gives the total count of crimes for each distinct latitude-longitude group.

It's important to note that the query above might not be the most efficient solution for large datasets, as it would generate a large number of rows due to the fine granularity of latitude and longitude values. You may consider using GIS functions if your database supports geospatial data types and queries, which can be more efficient for this kind of task. You would also need to ensure that the database is properly indexed to speed up the grouping and counting process."," Here is a possible SQL query that fulfills the request:

```sql
WITH 
latitude_ranges AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS lat_range
    FROM

longitude_ranges AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS lon_range

    SELECT 
        CONCAT('(', FORMAT(lat_range, '9999.999° N; 799999° W.999,999° W.'
```
The query generates two CTEs (`latitude_ranges` and `longitude_ranges`) that calculate the lower bounds of the latitude and longitude ranges by rounding down the values and dividing by 100. A third CTE, `latitude_longitude_ranges`, combines the ranges using the CONCAT function and formats them with two decimal places. Finally, the outer SELECT query counts the total number of crimes for each combined latitude and longitude range by joining the CTEs with the original `nyc_crime_data` table."

```

This query first rounds the latitude and longitude values to the nearest 0.01 degrees using the FLOOR() function and multiplies them by 100, effectively creating groups for each coordinate spaced 0.01 degrees. Then, it finds the count of each crime_type for each group in the CrimeRate CTE (Common Table Expression).

In the MaxCrimeRates CTE, it finds the rows with the maximum count per group using the ROW_NUMBER() function. If multiple crime_types have the same maximum count for a group, they are sorted in the order provided by the PARTITION BY clause.

Finally, the main SELECT statement fetches the latitude, longitude, crime_type, and crime_count from the MaxCrimeRates CTE, filtering only the rows with the highest crime count (i.e., rn = 1). The result set is ordered by latitude and longitude."," To fulfill the given request, we would need to use a combination of SQL statements that allow us to group the data by the required increments and aggregate based on crime types. Given the requirement to space coordinates by 0.01 degrees, we will use the FLOOR function to group the latitude and longitude into 0.01 degree increments.

However, it's important to note that the COUNT and the mode (most common) of crime types will result in aggregate modes, which are not easily obtainable with standard SQL functions alone due to the requirement to get the most common item within subgroups (0.01 degree increments). An ideal solution might require experimenting with different database-specific extensions and functions for calculating multimodal statistics or using a programming environment for post-processing.

For demonstration, I'll provide an SQL query that approximates your request within its constraints. This query will calculate the most common crime type within each 0.01 degree latitude and longitude group for New York. The query focuses on aggregating crime types but keeping in mind that SQL might not directly support getting the most common crime type per group in a simple group by; thus, the solution could be database-specific or might need to incorporate external processing or extensions.

```sql
SELECT 
    FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS GroupedLatitude, 
    FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS GroupedLongitude,
    V1.Crime_Type AS MostCommonCrimeType,
    V1.CrimeCount
FROM
    (SELECT 
        Crime_Type, 
        FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS LatGroup,
        FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS LongGroup,
        COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
     FROM nyc_crime_data
     WHERE Area_Name = 'New York'
     GROUP BY Crime_Type, LatGroup, LongGroup
     ORDER BY LatGroup, LongGroup, CrimeCount DESC) AS V1
JOIN
    (SELECT 
        Latitude, 
        Longitude, 
        FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS LatGroup,
        FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS LongGroup
     FROM nyc_crime_data
     WHERE Area_Name = 'New York') AS V2
ON V1.LatGroup = V2.LatGroup AND V1.LongGroup = V2.LongGroup
GROUP BY GroupedLatitude, GroupedLongitude;
```

This query attempts to group the data by 0.01-degree increments in latitude and longitude (using basic arithmetic operations and the FLOOR function) and counts occurrences of each crime type within these groups, then tries to join this result itself to ensure it's considering each 0.01 degree bin. However, this approach does not directly resolve the most common crime type per group in a single SQL statement due to SQL's limitations in handling such statistical computations directly.

For a more precise and database-accurate solution, consider using a programming language like Python with a library like Pandas for data manipulation, along with SQL for data extraction. This would allow you to leverage statistical functions or libraries designed for such calculations, providing a more accurate and potentially more efficient solution."," To fulfill the natural language request, we can accomplish this by using the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLOOR(Latitude) AS lat_floor,
    FLOOR(Longitude) AS long_floor,
    Crime_Type,
    COUNT(Crime_Type) AS Crime_Count
FROM 
    nyc_crime_data
GROUP BY 
    lat_floor, long_floor, Crime_Type
ORDER BY 
    lat_floor, long_floor, Crime_Count DESC
```

This query groups the crime data by FLOOR of latitude and longitude (which will assist in achieving the 0.01 degree grouping effect as needed). It also groups by Crime_Type, which allows us to count the occurrences of each crime type. The ORDER BY clause is used to order rows first by lat_floor, then by long_floor, and finally by Crime_Count in descending order ensures that the most common crime type appears first.

Please note that this solution is an approximation to fulfill the requirements based on the database design. The real implementation depends on how precise you need the calculation to be, and the use of PostGIS or a similar extension might be more suitable for precise geo-spatial calculations.

For an exact solution for a ""0.01-degree"" latitude and longitude grouping, create a custom function, or perform lat/long calculations in your programming code to calculate the correct grouping boundaries using spherical coordinates and the Haversine formula. You can then join the calculated dimensions with your crime data to arrive at the exact solution. Building such custom code solutions is beyond the basic SQL query capabilities due to Earth's curvature consideration, which is not accounted for in the simplified query above."

However, the specific syntax might vary depending on the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.) you're using. The query will assume you have a table named ""Crimes"" with columns for the latitude and longitude of each recorded crime, as well as any additional identifier needed to count them.

Please note that you cannot query for ""each coordinate in latitude and longitude of Philly spaced by 0.01 degrees"" directly in SQL since it's not designed to generate data on the fly. Instead, you can either:

1. Use a data generation expression (like a numbers or tally table) to create the required latitudes and longitudes, assuming you know the boundaries of Philly. However, this method may lead to a large dataset for the boundaries, even if densly populated.
2. Or, query the actual crimes recorded within each 0.01-degree square and count them.

For the second approach, here's an example SQL query for counting the number of crimes per 0.01-degree latitude and longitude square in Philadelphia, assuming you have the boundary values for latitude and longitude of Philadelphia, and that your table's latitude and longitude are in decimal degrees:

```sql
SELECT
    FLOOR(c.latitude * 100) / 100 AS lat_grid,
    FLOOR(c.longitude * 100) / 100 AS long_grid,
    COUNT(*) AS crime_count
FROM
    Crimes c
WHERE
    c.latitude BETWEEN ? AND ? -- replace these placeholders with the minimum and maximum latitude for Philadelphia
    AND c.longitude BETWEEN ? AND ? -- replace these placeholders with the minimum and maximum longitude for Philadelphia
GROUP BY
    lat_grid,
    long_grid
ORDER BY
    lat_grid,
    long_grid;
```

Please replace the placeholders with the actual minimum and maximum latitude and longitude values for Philadelphia before running the query. This SQL query uses FLOOR to group the latitude and longitude values into 0.01-degree squares, counts the number of rows (crimes) in each group, and orders the result by the grid.

Please note that this example query assumes you are using a relational database system that follows this syntax, such as PostgreSQL or SQL Server. The query may need to be adjusted for SQL dialects like MySQL or Oracle."," To fulfill the request, the following SQL query can be used. This query assumes that the geographical area for a single crime entry is defined by one set of latitude and longitude values. It also assumes that the crime count should be categorized by pairs of latitude and longitude values spaced by 0.01 degrees. We will use SQL's ROUND() function to round the latitude and longitude values to the nearest 0.01 degrees:

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(Latitude, 2) AS Rounded_Latitude,
  ROUND(Longitude, 2) AS Rounded_Longitude,
  COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Crime_Count
FROM philly_crime_data
GROUP BY
  Rounded_Latitude,
  Rounded_Longitude
ORDER BY
  Rounded_Latitude,
  Rounded_Longitude;
```

This query will give you the total crime count for each 0.01-degree latitude and longitude grid in Philadelphia. The results will be rounded to two decimal places and then grouped by these rounded coordinates. Note that this query may not provide perfect results depending on the actual spatial distribution of crimes, as the 0.01-degree grid may cover a large area in reality. However, it should provide a reasonable approximation based on the provided schema."," To fulfill the request, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    FLOOR(Longitude * 100) / 100 AS Longitude_Floor,
    FLOOR(Latitude * 100) / 100 AS Latitude_Floor,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Crime_Count
FROM
    philly_crime_data
GROUP BY
    Longitude_Floor,
    Latitude_Floor;
```

This query groups the rows based on the latitude and longitude values rounded down to the nearest multiple of 0.01 degrees. Then, it calculates the number of crime records (`COUNT(*)`) per group and returns the rounded latitude and longitude coordinates along with the total crime count.

Note that the ""FLOOR"" function is used to round down the longitude and latitude values when multiplied by 100. This effectively groups the coordinates spaced by 0.01 degrees. Depending on the precision requirements or the SQL dialect you are using, you might need to adjust the query accordingly."

This SQL query creates a grid of coordinates spaced by 0.01 degrees and then calculates the most common crime type and its count for each coordinate.

ORDER BY Crime_Count DESC, pcd.Latitude, pcd.Longitude, ct.Crime_Type;

This query first creates a temporary result set that contains all the distinct latitude and longitude values from philly_crime_data. Then, it joins each coordinate with all the crime types and their associated Crime_IDs. After that, it filters out the crime records that fall within the 0.01-degree range around each coordinate. Finally, it groups the result by latitude, longitude, and crime type, and sorts it by the crime count in descending order and the geographical location. Note that the boundaries are a little bit inclusive due to the definition of the 0.01 degree range.

There are a couple of issues with this query:

1. Joining each coordinate with all crime types and IDs is not the most efficient way of solving the problem. A better approach would be to group the crime data by latitude and longitude and then compute the most common crime type for each group.

2. The CROSS JOIN operation is not very efficient, especially with large datasets. This can be slow and can lead to memory issues. Instead, consider using a more efficient method, such as a correlated subquery or a window function, to compute the most common crime type for each coordinate range.

An improved solution could look like this:

2. ""popular_crime_area"" CTE finds the most common area for each type of crime.
3. ""crime_by_week"" CTE calculates the number of crimes for each type by week.
4. The main SELECT query brings together the results from the previous CTEs and calculates the percentage increase in each crime type by week, excluding the first week since percentage increase cannot be calculated for the first week.

This query breaks down like this:

- `SELECT Crime_Type`: This selects the crimes and types we're interested in – the types of crime are what we want to count.
- `COUNT(*) AS Total_Count`: This counts the number of entries for each type of crime. The `as Total_Count` part renames the column header to something more understandable.
- `FROM philly_crime_data`: This tells SQL that we're working with the `philly_crime_data` table.
- `GROUP BY Crime_Type`: This groups the data by the `Crime_Type` column, so we get a separate count for each different type of crime.
- `ORDER BY Total_Count DESC;`: This orders the results by the total count in descending order (most common crime types at the top).

When you run this query, the result will be a table with a row for each crime type and a column for the total number of instances of that crime type in the `philly_crime_data` table. Each table entry will correspond to a crime type from the 'top entries' of the table you provided.

This SQL query assumes that there is a table named `CrimesTable` with at least two columns: `crime_date` (a date or datetime type that holds the date of the crime) and `crime_type` (a string or variable type that holds the type of crime).

The query does the following:

- It filters the crime records to only include crimes that occurred in Atlanta.
- It groups the records by the day of the week (`DAYNAME(crime_date)`) and the crime type (`crime_type`).
- It counts the number of crimes for each group.
- Finally, it orders the result set by the day of the week and the crime type alphabetically."," To fulfill the given request, we will write an SQL query that groups the data by `Area_Name`, `Crime_Type`, and the name of the day extracted from `Day_Occurred`. We can use the built-in `DAYNAME()` function for this purpose. Finally, we will count the number of occurrences for each group. The following SQL query achieves this:

This query uses the GROUP BY statement to arrange the crime types and days of the week, while counting their occurrences using COUNT(). The WHERE condition filters the data for incidents that occurred in Atlanta. The DAYOFWEEK() function is used to extract the day of the week from the date data, with Sunday represented as 1 and Saturday as 7. The query results are sorted first by the day of the week, and then in descending order of the crime count.

Please note that the DAYOFWEEK() function returns an integer value representing the day of the week. If you need the day of the week in a more human-readable format, you may need to create a case statement or use a separate function based on your DBMS.

Note: The DAYOFWEEK function is available in MySQL. Different DBMS might have different functions for extracting the day of the week from a date. You may need to adapt the query depending on the specific DBMS you are using."

Explanation:
1. The `Crime_Type` is selected directly from the table.
2. From the `Crime_Time` column, we use the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour of the day and create a new column `Hour_of_the_day`.
3. We use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of crime events for each `Crime_Type` and `Hour_of_the_day`.
4. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the rows where the `Area_Name` is 'New York'.
5. `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the data by `Crime_Type` and `Hour_of_the_day`. 
6. Finally, the result is ordered by `Crime_Type` and `Hour_of_the_day`.

This query assumes that you have a table named `crimes` with columns `crime_type`, `date`, and `city`. Here, `crime_type` stores the type of crime, `date` stores the date the crime occurred (assumed to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'), and `city` stores the name of the city where the crime happened.

```SQL
SELECT 
    crime_type, 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year, 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_occurrences

WHERE 
    city = 'New York'
GROUP BY 
    crime_type,
    year,

```

This SQL query does the following:

1. Selects the `crime_type` and extracts `year` and `month` from the `date` column using the `EXTRACT()` function.
2. Counts the number of occurrences of each crime type (`COUNT(*)`) for each combination of month and year.
3. Filters the data to include only crimes that occurred in New York (`WHERE city = 'New York'`).
4. Groups the results by `crime_type`, `year`, and `month` so that you get a count of each crime type for each month.
5. Orders the results first by `year` and then by `month`.

By running this query, you will get a list of each crime type along with the year, month, and the number of times that crime occurred in New York for each month."," To fulfill the request, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    Crime_Type,
    YEAR(Crime_Date) AS Year,

    COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM nyc_crime_data
WHERE Area_Name = 'New York'
GROUP BY Crime_Type, Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month, Crime_Type;
```

This query will give you the count of each crime type for each month in New York. The `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions extract the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT Crime_Type, YEAR(Crime_Date) AS Year, MONTH(Crime_Date) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS Count`: This part selects the columns to be displayed in the resulting table: 
   - `Crime_Type` is the crime type.
   - `YEAR(Crime_Date)` is the year extracted from the `Crime_Date` column, and it is renamed to `Year`.
   - `MONTH(Crime_Date)` is the month extracted from the `Crime_Date` column, and it is renamed to `Month`.
   - `COUNT(*)` counts the number of occurrences of each crime type in the selected year and month, and this column is named `Count`.
2. `FROM nyc_crime_data`: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
3. `WHERE Area_Name = 'New York'`: This condition filters the records by the area name, selecting only New York records.
4. `GROUP BY Crime_Type, Year, Month`: This groups the results by crime type, year, and month, which allows the query to count the occurrences of each crime type in each month.
5. `ORDER BY Year, Month, Crime_Type`: This part sorts the result by year, month, and crime type. This is optional, but it can help to read the data in a more organized way."," Here's an SQL query to fulfill the natural language request:

This SQL query will give you the count of each crime type for each month in New York. The query is written in MySQL syntax:

1. We first select the columns Crime_Type and Crime_Date, and count the number of occurrences of each crime type in the NYC area.
2. Then, we format Crime_Date column to display Year-Month format for easier comparison.
3. We then filter out the data for the area named 'New York' using WHERE clause.
4. The GROUP BY clause is then used to group the rows by crime type and month.
5. Finally, the results are ordered by Month and Crime_Type for easier readability."

Additionally, we need the date in the table to contain the day of the week information. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT
    CrimeType,
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM Date) AS DayOfWeek, -- Extracts the day of the week from the date
    COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM
    Crimes
WHERE
    City = 'Philly' -- Filters results for only Philly
GROUP BY
    CrimeType,
    DayOfWeek
ORDER BY
    CrimeType,
    DayOfWeek;
```

In this query, we use `EXTRACT(DOW FROM Date)` to get the numeric representation of the day of the week. Based on the ISO 8601 standard, Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6.

Note that the exact syntax for extracting the day of the week may vary depending on the database system being used. For example, in MySQL, you can alternatively use `DAYOFWEEK(Date)` instead of `EXTRACT(DOW FROM Date)`.

Before running this query, make sure to replace `DOW` with the appropriate length of day numbers based on the database system being used.

Also, the names of the columns `CrimeType`, `Crime` and `Date` are placeholders, so you should use the correct column names in the actual database schema. The column `City` is used to filter out the crimes that occurred specifically in Philly. If the column is named differently or more details (like year, month, etc.) are required in the output, modifications to the query will be necessary."," Here's an SQL query that fulfills the request:

```sql
SELECT 
    Crime_Type,
    DAYNAME(Crime_Date) AS Day_Of_Week,
    COUNT(*) AS Crime_Count
FROM

WHERE 
    City = 'Philly' -- Assuming there is a 'City' column; else, remove the WHERE clause
GROUP BY 
    Crime_Type,
    DAYNAME(Crime_Date)
ORDER BY 
    Crime_Type, 
    DAYOFWEEK(Crime_Date)
```

This query will return the crime type, the day of the week (using `DAYNAME` function), and the count of crimes for each combination of crime type and day of the week, where the city column is 'Philly'. If there's no 'City' column, you can remove the WHERE clause to get the crime data for all cities. The `DAYNAME` function is used to convert the `Crime_Date` column to the name of the day. Additionally, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result by the crime type and the day of the week using the `DAYOFWEEK` function.

If the city information is stored in the `Area_#` or `Address` columns, you'll need to adjust the WHERE clause accordingly, like this:

```sql
WHERE 
    Area_# LIKE '%Philly%'
```

or

```sql
WHERE 
    Address LIKE '%Philly%'
```

If the 'Area_#' or 'Address' column format is different, adjust the pattern to match the desired filter."," Here is the SQL query to fulfill the request:

GROUP BY 
    DATEPART(dw, Crime_Date),
    Crime_Type
ORDER BY
    Day_of_Week,
    Crime_Type;
```

In this query, we use the `DATEPART` function to extract the day of week from `Crime_Date` column. We select the subquery's result along with the `Crime_Type` column and count all rows by grouping by day of week and `Crime_Type`. The WHERE clause is used to exclude entries with no valid day (in case there are non-date values in the database). Finally, the result set is ordered by day of week and then crime type.

This query assumes that the SQL Server uses Sunday as the first day of the week (i.e., SET DATEFIRST 7). If your SQL Server has a different setting, please modify the query accordingly.

Please note that the given database schema represents a single table (`philly_crime_data`) that logs all crimes in Philly, and the seven actual days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) are included in the result set using the `DATEPART` function combination to obtain a numeric value for the day of week (1-7, where Sunday is 1 and Saturday is 7)."

- `crime_type` is the column that holds the type of crime.
- `crime_time` is the column that holds the timestamp for when the crime occurred.
- `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM crime_time)` is a function that extracts the hour part from the `crime_time` timestamp.
- `city = 'Philly'` is the condition to filter the records for the city of Philadelphia.
- `GROUP BY crime_type, hour_of_day` groups the results by each type of crime and for each hour of the day.
- `COUNT(*) AS crime_count` calculates the count of crimes for each type and for each hour.
- `ORDER BY crime_type, hour_of_day` orders the result set first by `crime_type` and then by `hour_of_day`.

1. It extracts the hour from the `Crime_Time` column using the `EXTRACT()` function.
2. It groups the result by `Crime_Type` and the extracted hour.
3. It then counts the number of occurrences for each `Crime_Type` at each hour using the `COUNT(*)` function.
4. Finally, it orders the result by `Crime_Type` and `Hour_Of_Day`.
