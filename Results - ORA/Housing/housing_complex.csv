    GROUP BY
        zipcode
    ) AS post_covid
ON
    pre_covid.zipcode = post_covid.zipcode;
```

This SQL query does the following:

1. Subselects a list of unique Atlanta zipcodes (`^30*`) from the `housing_rent` table.
2. It then joins two grouped subqueries, each one of them calculating the average house rent for pre-COVID (2019) and post-COVID (2022) periods for individual Atlanta zipcodes.
3. The final result displays the zipcode, the average rent for pre-COVID and post-COVID periods, and the difference (change) in average rent between the periods.","Given the schema of the table referencing a national zip code detail, we would modify the SQL query to reference the full basis of zcta5 codes that denote Atlanta, Georgia. Since the named entity 'Atlanta' refers to a subset of the table explicitly, we'll use a WHERE clause to filter our search criteria to only those related to Atlanta. The schema of the table obviously includes 'zipcode' which would signify those zipcodes within the Atlanta setting.

Other conditions:

1. We'll make use of two subqueries to calculate the average rents for the years 2019 and 2022.
2. We'll find a way to relate the change in average rent from 2019 to 2022 for every zipcode in the specified area to those zipcodes related to Atlanta.

        )
    GROUP BY
        zipcode
) AS AvgRentPerZip
```

This code selects zip codes from the 'housing_rent' table where the city_name is 'Atlanta'. For these zip code locations, it calculates the average rent value for 2019 and 2022. Finally, it calculates the difference between the average rent from 2019 and 2022 for each zip code location."

After we have the average values for each of these years, we can find the difference in average house rent for each zipcode.

Here's an SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT r1.zipcode,
       (r2.avg_rent - r1.avg_rent) AS rent_change
FROM (
    SELECT a.zipcode, AVG(b.house_value_min) AS avg_rent
    FROM housing_value a

    WHERE a.year = 2022
    GROUP BY a.zipcode
) r1
JOIN (
    SELECT zipcode, AVG(house_value_min) AS avg_rent
    FROM housing_value
    WHERE year = 2017 AND zipcode IN(
        SELECT DISTINCT a.zipcode
        FROM housing_value a
        JOIN housing_value b ON a.zipcode = b.zipcode AND b.year = 2022)
    GROUP BY zipcode
) r2 ON r1.zipcode = r2.zipcode
```

This query consists of multiple parts:
- The first and second subqueries (`r1` and `r2`) calculate the average house rent for the years 2017 and 2022 separately.
- The `JOIN` statement connects the two subqueries based on the `zipcode` column, ensuring that each zipcode in the output is present for both years.
- The final `SELECT` statement calculates the change in average house rent by subtracting the average rent in 2017 from the average rent in 2022 for each zipcode.

Note: This solution assumes that the `house_value_min` column can be used as an approximation of the average rent value in each zipcode. If more accurate rent values are available, you can adjust the query accordingly.","SELECT

This query first joins the `economic_income_and_benefits` (aliased as `eia`) and `housing_mortgage` (aliased as `h`) tables on the `year` and `id` columns to relate the data for each zipcode. 

Then, it calculates the percentage of units with mortgage by dividing the `units_with_mortgage` by the `total_households` and multiplying the result by 100. Next, the query selects the `median_household_income` from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table.

Finally, it groups the results by `zipcode` and orders the output by `zipcode`.

Note that the original table schema does not have a `total_households` column necessary to compute the percentage of units with mortgage. If the `total_households` value is instead the `total_households` from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table, you can modify the query as follows:

- Filters the rows from the joined tables to only include those from the year 2022.
- Groups the result by `zipcode`, as we want to find average housing value and median household income for each zipcode.
- Calculates the average housing value by taking the average of `house_value_min` and `house_value_max` for each zipcode.
- Calculates the average median household income by taking the average of `median_household_income` for each zipcode.","```sql

- We join the `social_education_attainment` (aliased as `e`) and `housing_value` (aliased as `h`) tables based on the `zipcode` and `year` columns. (Assuming that the `housing_value` table also has a state column or there is another table that indicates state for each zipcode.)
- We filter the data for the year 2022 and only consider zipcodes in Georgia. (You can modify the state filter as per your data schema.)
- The percentage of the population with associate, bachelors, and graduate or professional degree(s) or higher is computed using the sum of the relevant columns divided by the sum of the `population_25_years_and_over` column.
- The average housing price is computed using the average of the `house_value_min` and `house_value_max` columns for each zipcode.
- The result is grouped by the `zipcode` column and ordered by it.","SELECT

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    hr.zipcode, 
    AVG(hr.rent_value_min + hr.rent_value_max) / 2 AS avg_housing_rent, 
    100 * SUM(if(sciui.with_broadband_internet_subscription != 0, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) AS percentage_broadband_subscription
FROM 
    housing_rent hr   
JOIN 
    social_computer_internet_usage sciui 
ON hr.year = sciui.year AND hr.zipcode = sciui.zipcode
WHERE 
    hr.year > 2016
GROUP BY 
    hr.zipcode;
```

Explanation:

1. The `FROM` clause joins the `housing_rent` table (`hr`) and the `social_computer_internet_usage` table (`sciui`) on the `year` and `zipcode` columns.
2. The `WHERE` clause filters the data for years after 2016.
3. The `SELECT` clause calculates the average housing rent per zipcode by adding the minimum and maximum rent values and dividing by 2. The `SUM` function in the `percentage_broadband_subscription` calculation counts the number of rows where there is a broadband subscription, and the `COUNT` function counts the total rows. Dividing the two numbers gives the percentage.
4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `zipcode`.
5. We use the `IF` function in the `SUM` to handle values where there is a broadband subscription by counting those rows as 1 and the others as 0.

Note that this query assumes the `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max` columns are denoting the minimum and maximum rental values per unit for each house, and not the total values for all houses with those values. If the `with_broadband_internet_subscription` values in the `social_computer_internet_usage` table are equal to the number of houses that have a subscription within the total households, the above formula will be applied. If the data does not work this way, the formula should be adjusted accordingly according to the actual data distribution.","Here is the SQL code:

  h.year, 
  h.zipcode, 
  AVG(h.rent_value_max) AS avg_rent,
