```sql
SELECT 
  YEARWEEK(Crime_Date, 3) /* Use MySQL mode 3 to start week on Monday */,
  COUNT(*)
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Crime_Date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(Crime_Date, 3)
ORDER BY Crime_Date;
```

This will give you the total count of crimes in Atlanta grouped by week, starting from January 2009. The `YEARWEEK` function takes a date and a mode as input, and returns the year and week number. Using mode 3 tells MySQL to start counting weeks from the first Monday following the start of the year, which makes it compatible with our request to group by week.

Please modify this query according to your DBMS as not all DBMSes use the same week starting day. For example, SQLite uses Sunday as the first day of the week by default, so you don't need to pass any mode to it. For PostgreSQL, you can simply use the `date_trunc` function as they don't define the first day of the week as their behavior varies across different locales.

For PostgreSQL, this should do the trick:

```sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('week', Crime_Date)::date,
  COUNT(*)
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Crime_Date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY date_trunc('week', Crime_Date)::date
ORDER BY Crime_Date;
```

Remember to replace the date and/or table name in the queries if they don't match your schema.","SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', Crime_Date) AS week, COUNT(*) AS total_crimes

The query assumes the entire data resides in the nyc_crime_data table.

Here is the SQL query for this requirement:

```sql

GROUP BY

ORDER BY

```

Explanation:

1. The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM STR_TO_DATE(Crime_Time, '%I:%i %p')) AS Crime_Hour` part extracts the hour part of the Crime_Time field and aliases it as Crime_Hour. Note that we’re using STR_TO_DATE to convert Crime_Time to a proper time value.

2. `COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes` gets the total number of crimes that occur at each hour.

3. The `WHERE Area_Name = 'NEW YORK'` clause filters only the crimes that occur in ""New York"".

4. The `GROUP BY Crime_Hour` clause groups the result set based on each hour of the day.

5. The `ORDER BY Crime_Hour` clause sorts the result according to the hour of the day.

Please note that the format of the Crime_Time field is not provided in the provided table structure. The example assumes a US format like ""02:00 PM"". The STR_TO_DATE portion of the query will need to be adapted if the format of Crime_Time differs.
Note that SQL functions and syntax could differ based on the SQL database engine you're using (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). So this specific query may need to be adapted accordingly.","SELECT Time, COUNT(*) as Total_Crimes

FROM atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY LatitudeRange, LongitudeRange, Crime_Type
ORDER BY LatitudeRange, LongitudeRange, CrimesCount DESC

```

This query creates groups in latitudinal and longitudinal steps of 0.01 degrees and calculates the most common crime type within each group, along with the count of crimes for that type.

Note that the `LIMIT 1` clause will only return one row; you would need to remove or adjust it if you need more than one group result. Additionally, this query will return only the most common crime for the very first group (the one with the smallest latitude and longitude range) among the ordered groupings; if you want to get the most common crimes for all the groups, you would need to use a window function, which is not supported in all database platforms.

If the original question is aiming to return the most common crime for each group, here is an alternative using a window function called `ROW_NUMBER()`:

```sql
WITH ranked_crimes AS (
  SELECT 
    FLOOR(latitude / 0.01) * 0.01 AS LatitudeRange,

This query selects the `Latitude` and `Longitude`, rounded to 2 decimal places, along with the count of `Crime_ID` as `Total_Crime_Count`. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only the coordinates within the Atlanta city bounds, assuming that the given coordinates span the entire Atlanta city area. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by `Latitude` and `Longitude`, allowing us to count the total number of crimes for each coordinate pair. Finally, the `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by `Latitude` and `Longitude` in ascending order.

Please note that the range for latitude and longitude might not be accurate for the complete region of Atlanta. You may need to adjust the range to reflect the actual bounds of the city.","Based on your request, an SQL query should look like this:

  AND Longitude BETWEEN -84.412846 + 0.01 AND -84.301414 - 0.01
GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude
```

Why this query works:

- I've selected the Latitude, Longitude and the count of total crimes for each set of (Latitude, Longitude) pair.

- The WHERE clause is used to filter data that is in the range of 32.35888 to 33.77476 in Latitude and -84.412846 to -84.301414 in Longitude. We are modifying the values of latitude and longitude with a decrease of 0.01.

- The GROUP BY clause groups the selected records by Latitude and Longitude so that we can calculate the total crime count for each coordinate.

NOTE: This query assumes that the latitude and longitude values are in decimal format. If the values are in degrees format, they would not relate as expected, and modifications would be required to convert the degrees."

This query starts by calculating floating-point latitude and longitude bins for the given crime data. A bin is created by rounding down the latitude and longitude to a certain decimal place, in this case, two decimal places for a resolution of 0.01 degrees. Then it counts the number of crimes in each bin and groups results by 'Lat_Bin' and 'Long_Bin'. The query uses `FLOOR` combined with mathematical operations to formulate the bin ranges for latitude and longitude.

The query's result will provide the total crime count for each latitude&longitude pair, with intervals of 0.01 degrees, in addition to allowing customization of the desired density of data points by small increments in the result.

Please note that this query will generate multiple bins for each coordinate, each with a width of 0.01 degrees. Depending on the data distribution, a significant portion of the data may be included in the first few larger bins. If precise geographic boundaries are important for this analysis, spatial databases and GIS techniques may offer better solutions.","```sql

The query creates a grid table using the generate_series() function and then applies the get_grid_id() function to calculate the grid index for each latitude and longitude. The spatial join between the input data and the grid is then done using ST_Contains() function. The query then groups the data by grid cell and crime type and returns the most common crime type and its count.

Note: You might need to adjust the parameters in the derived tables, get_grid_id() function, and ST_Contains() function to match your needs.

Also, note that the actual SQL query optimized for performance and accuracy may vary depending on the database engine, spatial indexing, etc., so please modify the query accordingly.","SELECT

In this query, we use the ROUND() function to round the latitude and longitude to the nearest third decimal place (0.01 degrees). Then, we group by the rounded latitude, rounded longitude, and the crime type. Finally, we count the occurrences of each crime type and order the results by the count in descending order.

You need to replace `@minutesInDegrees` with the appropriate calculation to convert 0.01 degrees to minutes. For latitude and longitude:

```sql
DECLARE @minutesInDegrees DECIMAL(7, 5) = 0.01 * 4;  -- multiply by 4 since there are 4 minutes in 0.01 degree
```

You can now use the SQL query with the defined `@minutesInDegrees` variable to fetch the most common crime type and its count for each coordinate in New York spaced by 0.01 degrees.","```sql

Explanation: 

- This query groups crimes by their longitude and latitude coordinates, rounded to the nearest 0.01 degrees. To achieve this, we use `FLOOR(Longitude) - (-180)` and `FLOOR(Latitude) - (-90)`
- `COUNT(*) as TotalCrimeCount` calculates the total number of crimes for each group of coordinates.
- `HAVING FLOOR(Latitude) - (-90) BETWEEN (-90 - 0.01) AND -90` and `FLOOR(Latitude) - (-90) BETWEEN -90 AND (-90 + 0.01)` ensures that we only get coordinates in Philadelphia by filtering out ones outside the valid ranges.

  FROM atlanta_crime_data
  GROUP BY Crime_Type, Area_Name
) AS Areas

    SELECT Crime_Type, MAX(Count) AS Max_Count
    FROM (
        SELECT Crime_Type, Area_Name, COUNT(*) AS Count
        FROM atlanta_crime_data
        GROUP BY Crime_Type, Area_Name
    ) AS SubAreas
    GROUP BY Crime_Type
) AS Crimes ON Areas.Crime_Type = Crimes.Crime_Type AND Areas.Count = Crimes.Max_Count;
```

5. Percentage increase in crime type by week
```sql
SELECT main.Crime_Type, COUNT(*) / (sub.Weeks + 1) AS avg_count_per_week,
       ((COUNT(*) / (sub.Weeks + 1)) - (COUNT(*)/(sub.Weeks)) ) / (COUNT(*)/sub.Weeks) * 100 AS percentage_increase
FROM atlanta_crime_data main,
     (
        SELECT Crime_Type,
               COUNT(DISTINCT YEARWEEK(Crime_Date)) AS Weeks
        FROM atlanta_crime_data
        GROUP BY Crime_Type
     ) sub
WHERE main.Crime_Type = sub.Crime_Type
GROUP BY main.Crime_Type;
```

Please note that the fifth SQL query assumes that you have at least two weeks of data per crime type. If there is less than two weeks of data for a crime type, the percentage increase calculation won't be applicable or meaningful for that crime type.

In summary, to fulfill the original request, you can perform each of the five queries independently and combine their results.

This SQL query retrieves the count of each crime type for each day of the week in Atlanta. The row is grouped by day of the week (from 1 for Sunday to 7 for Saturday) and crime type, which corresponds to the count of crimes for each day and type. The day of the week is represented as the integer number of the day in the week in the `DAYOFWEEK()` function. The `'Atlanta'` filter in the WHERE clause ensures that only crimes in Atlanta are considered. The result is sorted by both the day of the week and crime type in ascending order.","You can accomplish this by using SQL's conditional aggregate functions, specifically SUM and COUNT, along with CASE statement (or similar) to differentiate between the types, and GROUP BY day_occurred date to get per-day totals. Keep in mind, without a day-column (it might be in a format where days are the first three words) you might have trouble distinguishing between days. Here's what the SQL might look like:

```sql

  SUM(CASE
    WHEN Day_Occurred IS NULL

  ELSE 0
  END) AS Number_With_Day_Info
FROM atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY Day_Of_Week, Crime_Type;
```

Note: If Day_Occurred is null, it would be counted as 1. Otherwise it would be 0, and would be added to the totals of the conditions. If you don't want to count NULLs in total, just ignore that part."
