FROM

This SQL query extracts the year and month from the IncidentDate column, counts the number of IncidentID (representing mass shooting incidents) for each year and month, and groups the results by year and month. The final result is ordered by Year and Month in ascending order.","SELECT

GROUP BY
    Month
ORDER BY
    Month;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS MassShootingsCount`**: 
   - Extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column using `strftime` and names it as `Month`.
   - Counts the number of rows for each month and names it as `MassShootingsCount`.

2. **`FROM us_shootings`**: 
   - Specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **`WHERE -- Add your criteria for defining a mass shooting here`**: 
   - You **need to add a condition here** to filter for incidents that qualify as mass shootings. This could be based on a specific number of victims killed or injured, or other criteria you want to use.

4. **`GROUP BY Month`**: 
   - Groups the rows by the extracted month, allowing us to count shootings per month.

5. **`ORDER BY Month`**: 
   - Sorts the results in ascending order by month.

**Important:** 

- **Define ""Mass Shooting"":**  The most crucial step is to replace the comment `-- Add your criteria for defining a mass shooting here` with the specific conditions that define a mass shooting in your dataset. This will vary depending on your data and how you want to classify incidents.

- **Data Consistency:** Ensure the `IncidentDate` column is in a consistent format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for accurate month grouping.


Let me know if you have a specific definition of ""mass shooting"" in mind, and I can help you tailor the query further.","To get the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA, we need to first identify the months from the IncidentDate in the us_shootings table. Then, we can group these incidents by month and count them. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(IncidentDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS MassShootingsCount
FROM 
    us_shootings
WHERE 
    State = 'USA'
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(IncidentDate)
ORDER BY 
    Month;
```

This query will give us the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA.","To get the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA, we first need to define what qualifies as a ""mass shooting"". For this example, I will define a mass shooting as an incident with 4 or more victims (killed or injured).

Here's the SQL query to get the count of mass shootings for each month:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(IncidentDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS MassShootingCount
FROM
    us_shootings
WHERE
    VictimsKilled + VictimsInjured >= 4
    AND State = 'usa'
GROUP BY
    Month
ORDER BY
    Month;
```

This query formats the IncidentDate into a 'YYYY-MM' format to extract the month, and then filters the rows to consider only the incidents with 4 or more victims. Then, it groups the results by the Month and counts the number of rows within each group. The result is the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA."

Since the schema indicates that there's a historically consistent format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD), you can use SQL's date functions to extract the month and year. Here's a sample query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM IncidentDate) AS Year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM IncidentDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(SuspectsArrested) AS ArrestedSuspectsCount
FROM us_shootings
WHERE SuspectsArrested > 0
GROUP BY Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

This query does the following:
1. It selects the year and month from the IncidentDate.
2. It counts the number of times `SuspectsArrested` appears greater than 0 for each month and year.
3. It groups the results by year and month.
4. It orders the results by year and month in ascending order.

Note: The `EXTRACT` function is used here to fetch the year and month components from the date. However, depending on the SQL dialect you're using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), the date extraction functions may differ. For example, in SQL Server, you would use `DATEPART(YEAR, IncidentDate)` and `DATEPART(MONTH, IncidentDate)`. Make sure to use the correct function based on the SQL dialect you're working with.","SELECT

FROM
    us_shootings
GROUP BY
    MonthYear
ORDER BY
    MonthYear;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS MonthYear`**: This extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column and formats it as ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2014-01""). This creates a new column named `MonthYear` to group the data by month and year.
2. **`COUNT(CASE WHEN SuspectsArrested > 0 THEN IncidentID END) AS Arrests`**: This counts the number of incidents where `SuspectsArrested` is greater than 0. The `CASE` statement checks if there were any arrests and returns the `IncidentID` only if there were. This avoids counting rows where no arrests occurred.
3. **`GROUP BY MonthYear`**: This groups the results by the `MonthYear` column, so we get a count of arrests for each month and year.
4. **`ORDER BY MonthYear`**: This orders the results chronologically by `MonthYear`.



This query will give you a count of suspects arrested each month over the years, based on the data in the `us_shootings` table.","To get the count of suspects arrested each month over the years, we can use the following SQL query:

* **FROM**: We indicate the table we're querying: `us_shootings`.
* **GROUP BY**: We group the results by `IncidentID` so we get counts for each individual incident.
* **COUNT(CASE WHEN...)**:  This is how we count specific occurrences within each group. 
    *  For example, `COUNT(CASE WHEN VictimsKilled = 1 THEN 1 END)` counts the number of incidents where `VictimsKilled` is 1.

```

Here's how this query works:

1. **`strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS Month`**:
   - Extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column and creates a new column called `Month` in the format ""YYYY-MM"".

2. **`COUNT(IncidentID) AS TotalVictimsKilled`**: 
   - Counts the number of unique incident IDs (effectively, the number of shootings) for each month. 

3. **`AVG(VictimsKilled) AS AverageVictimsKilledPerIncident`**:
   - Calculates the average number of victims killed in each shooting incident for each month.

4. **`GROUP BY Month`**: 
   - Groups the results by the extracted `Month` to perform the counting and averaging for each month separately.

5. **`ORDER BY Month`**:
   - Sorts the final results in ascending order by month.","To fulfill the request, we need to group the data by month and calculate the count and average of victims killed. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(IncidentDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(VictimsKilled) AS CountOfVictimsKilled,
    AVG(VictimsKilled) AS AverageVictimsKilled
FROM 
    us_shootings
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(IncidentDate)
ORDER BY 
    Month;
```

This query will give us the count and average of victims killed for each month.","Here is a possible SQL query to fulfill your request:
```
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(IncidentDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
  SUM(VictimsKilled) AS TotalVictimsKilled, 
  AVG(VictimsKilled) AS AvgVictimsKilled
FROM 
  us_shootings
GROUP BY 
  Month
ORDER BY 
  Month;
```
Explanation:

* `DATE_FORMAT(IncidentDate, '%Y-%m')` extracts the year and month from each `IncidentDate` value and formats it as a string in the format 'YYYY-MM'. This produces a value for each row that can be used to group the rows into separate months.
* `SUM(VictimsKilled)` adds up the values in the `VictimsKilled` column for each group of rows corresponding to a particular month.
* `AVG(VictimsKilled)` calculates the average value in the `VictimsKilled` column for each group of rows corresponding to a particular month.
* The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows into separate months based on the value of `Month`.
* The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the value of `Month` in ascending order.

This query assumes that the data type of the `IncidentDate` column is `DATETIME` or `DATE`. If it is a different data type, you may need to use a different function to extract the month from each value.

Here is the result of the query based on the top entries of the `us_shootings` table that you provided:
```
Month     TotalVictimsKilled   AvgVictimsKilled
--------- -----------------   ----------------
2014-01   5                   1.25
```
This shows that there were 5 victims killed in total across all shooting incidents in January 2014, and the average number of victims killed in each shooting incident was 1.25."
