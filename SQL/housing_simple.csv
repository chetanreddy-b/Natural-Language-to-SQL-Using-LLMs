Here's an SQL query that can be used to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH yearly_average_GRAPI AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG((income_percent_min + income_percent_max) / 2) AS average_GRAPI
    FROM
        housing_gross_rent_percent
    GROUP BY
        year
), yearly_change_in_GRAPI AS (
    SELECT
        curr.year,
        (curr.average_GRAPI - prev.average_GRAPI) AS change_in_GRAPI
    FROM
        yearly_average_GRAPI curr
    LEFT JOIN
        yearly_average_GRAPI prev ON curr.year = prev.year + 1
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    yearly_change_in_GRAPI
ORDER BY
    year ASC;
```

This query does the following:

1. The `yearly_average_GRAPI` CTE (Common Table Expression) calculates the average GRAPI (Gross Rent as Percent of Household Income) for each year using the min and max values for that year (given as `income_percent_min` and `income_percent_max`, respectively) in our `housing_gross_rent_percent` table.

2. The `yearly_change_in_GRAPI` CTE calculates the year-on-year change in GRAPI by subtracting the `prev.average_GRAPI` from the `curr.average_GRAPI` for each year.

3. The final `SELECT` statement retrieves all entries from the `yearly_change_in_GRAPI` CTE, ordered by year in ascending order.

Note: The query uses a LEFT JOIN because there might be years in the `housing_gross_rent_percent` table without a previous year to compare. The LEFT JOIN will ensure that all years are included in the output, with a NULL `change_in_GRAPI` value for the first year(s) appearing in the table.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **YearlyGRAPI CTE:** This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the average `income_percent_max` (representing GRAPI) for each year.
2. **Main Query:**
   - It joins the `YearlyGRAPI` CTE with itself (aliased as `y1` and `y2`) to compare consecutive years.
   - It selects the year, the average GRAPI for both years, and calculates the year-on-year percentage change using the formula: `((y2.average_grapi - y1.average_grapi) / y1.average_grapi) * 100`.
   - It orders the results by year.

**Notes:**

- This query assumes you want to calculate the change year-on-year (e.g., 2015 to 2016, 2016 to 2017, etc.).
- The `AVG(income_percent_max)` calculation provides a representative GRAPI value for each year.","To get the year-on-year change in GRAPI, we need to calculate the difference in GRAPI values between two consecutive years. Could you specify the years you're interested in for this comparison?","To calculate the year-on-year change in GRAPI, we need data for two consecutive years.

However, since there is only one year in the provided table (2015), we cannot compute the year-on-year change as there's no previous year data. But assuming that we have the same table for multiple years (e.g., 2014, 2015, 2016), here is an SQL query that calculates the year-on-year change of SMOCAPI:

```sql
WITH Average_SMOCAPI AS (
  SELECT
    year,
    AVG((income_percent_max + income_percent_min) / 2) as avg_SMOCAPI
  FROM
    household_income_percent_with_mortgage
  GROUP BY
    year
)

SELECT
  a.year,
  a.avg_SMOCAPI,
  (a.avg_SMOCAPI - b.avg_SMOCAPI) as year_on_year_change
FROM
  Average_SMOCAPI a
LEFT JOIN
  Average_SMOCAPI b
ON
  a.year > b.year
ORDER BY
  a.year;
```

This query calculates the average SMOCAPI for each year in the Average_SMOCAPI CTE (Common Table Expression). Then, it performs a self-join on the CTE to compare the values from different years. The year-on-year change is calculated as the difference between the current year's average SMOCAPI and the previous year's average SMOCAPI. 

Please note that this query calculates the year-on-year change between all possible pairs of years, and the result might contain duplicate rows if the data includes multiple observations from the same year. If you need the year-on-year change only between consecutive years (e.g., 2015 -> 2016, but not 2015 -> 2014), you may need to adjust the JOIN condition to make sure the years are consecutive, like:

```sql
SELECT
  a.year,
  a.avg_SMOCAPI,
  (a.avg_SMOCAPI - LAG(a.avg_SMOCAPI) OVER (ORDER BY a.year)) as year_on_year_change
FROM
  Average_SMOCAPI a
ORDER BY
  a.year;
```

This approach uses window function LAG to calculate the change compared to the previous year.","You can use the following SQL query to get year-on-year change in SMOCAPI:

```sql
SELECT
    S1.year AS year_1,
    S1.income_percent_avg AS SMOCAPI_1,
    S2.year AS year_2,
    S2.income_percent_avg AS SMOCAPI_2,
    (S2.income_percent_avg - S1.income_percent_avg) AS year_on_year_change
FROM (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(income_percent_max) AS income_percent_avg
    FROM
        household_income_percent_with_mortgage
    WHERE
        income_percent_min = 0 AND income_percent_max = 100
    GROUP BY
        year
) S1
JOIN (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(income_percent_max) AS income_percent_avg
    FROM
        household_income_percent_with_mortgage
    WHERE
        income_percent_min = 0 AND income_percent_max = 100
    GROUP BY
        year
) S2 ON S1.year = S2.year - 1
ORDER BY
    year_1;
```

This query calculates SMOCAPI and its year-on-year change. It first finds the average income_percent_max for a given year where income_percent_min is 0 and income_percent_max is 100 (SMOCAPI) for each year using subqueries S1 and S2. Then, it joins the results of both subqueries on year. Finally, it calculates the year-on-year change in SMOCAPI for each year using the income_percent_avg values from S1 and S2.","```sql

```

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression):**
   - We create a CTE called `MonthlySMOCAPI` to calculate the average `income_percent_max` (representing SMOCAPI) for each year.

2. **Main Query:**
   - We use two instances of the `MonthlySMOCAPI` CTE: `m1` and `m2`. 
   - `m1` represents the current year's data.
   - `m2` represents the previous year's data. We join them on `year` using a condition `m1.year = m2.year + 1`.
   - We select the current year, the SMOCAPI for the current year, the SMOCAPI for the previous year, and the year-on-year change calculated as: `((current_year_smocapi - previous_year_smocapi) / previous_year_smocapi) * 100`.


**Note:** 
- Replace `year` and `income_percent_max` with your actual column names if they differ.
- This query assumes you want to calculate the year-on-year change for each year, starting from the second year in your data.","To get the year-on-year change in SMOCAPI, we need to first calculate the SMOCAPI for each year and then find the difference.

**Explanation:**

* **SELECT zipcode:** This selects the `zipcode` column from the table.
* **FROM household_income_percent_without_mortgage:** This specifies the table to query.
* **WHERE year = 2017:** This filters the data to only include entries for the year 2017.
* **AND zipcode LIKE 'GA%':** This filters for zip codes that start with 'GA', assuming this is a convention for Georgia zip codes.  You might need to adjust this based on your specific data.
* **AND income_percent_max > 28:** This filters for entries where the `income_percent_max` value is greater than 28.

**Note:**

* The `LIKE 'GA%'` filter assumes a standard pattern for Georgia zip codes. You may need to modify it if your data uses a different format.

Note: I am assuming that the `id` column follows a consistent format where the state code for Georgia ('GA') can be found in the 9th and 10th characters of the `id` string, and that the `state` column is not present in the table. If this is not the case, please provide the appropriate schema for the table and I can adjust the query accordingly.

Explanation:

* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include records from the year 2017.
* The `LIKE` operator is used to filter the `id` column to only include values that start with '8600000US' and are followed by the state code for Georgia ('GA').
* The `state` column is assumed to not be present in the table, and therefore the `id` column is used to determine the state for each record.

Note: I am not able to determine the exact SQL query to use to filter the `zipcode` values that belong to Georgia, as I do not have information about the structure or content of any other tables or columns in your database that relate to geographical information. You may need to consult your database's documentation or seek additional assistance in order to determine the correct method for filtering the `zipcode` values in this way.

Additionally, I made the assumption that the `income_percent_max` column represents the upper bound of the home-ownership costs as a percentage of household income for each row. If this interpretation is incorrect, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Here is an example of how you could filter the `zipcode` values using a `JOIN` clause with a table that contains geographical information, if one is available:
```
SELECT h.zipcode
FROM household_income_percent_with_mortgage h
JOIN geographical_information g ON h.zipcode = g.zipcode

In this query, replace `YOUR_SPECIFIED_YEAR` with the year you want to query for, e.g. `WHERE year = 2015`. The query calculates the average house price by taking the mid-value between the minimum and maximum house price (house_value_min and house_value_max) for each zip code in the specified year.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT zipcode, AVG(house_value_max) AS average_house_price`**: This selects the `zipcode` and calculates the average of `house_value_max` for each zip code. The average value is aliased as `average_house_price`.
2. **`FROM housing_value`**: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
3. **`WHERE year = '2015'`**: Filters the data to include only records from the specified year. Replace `2015` with the actual year you want.
4. **`GROUP BY zipcode`**: Groups the results by `zipcode`, allowing the average price to be calculated for each unique zip code. 


This query will return a table with two columns: `zipcode` and `average_house_price`, showing the average maximum house value for each zip code in the selected year.","To get the average house price for each zip code in a given year, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, AVG(house_value_min) AS average_house_price

GROUP BY zipcode;
```

This query will give us the average house price for each zip code in the year 2015.","Here is the SQL query to get the average house price for each zip code in a given year:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, AVG(house_value_max) AS average_house_price
FROM housing_value
WHERE year = YOUR_GIVEN_YEAR
GROUP BY zipcode;
```
Replace `YOUR_GIVEN_YEAR` with the year you want to get the average house price for. This query calculates the average house price for each zip code by finding the average of the `house_value_max` column, which represents the maximum value of a house in a given record. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by zip code, so you get a separate average for each zip code."

Please note that the SQL query might slightly differ based on the SQL dialect you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), and SQL Server does not have a built-in median function. However, we can use PERCENTILE_CONT in SQL Server (or the equivalent in other SQL dialects) to calculate the median.

Here's an example query using SQL Server syntax:

```sql
WITH ZipcodeHousingValue AS (
  SELECT
    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode) AS MedianMinPrice
  FROM housing_value
)

SELECT DISTINCT
  zipcode,
  MedianMinPrice
FROM ZipcodeHousingValue;
```

In the example query above, we're using a common table expression (CTE) called ZipcodeHousingValue to calculate the median house_value_min for each zipcode using the PERCENTILE_CONT function in a window-based approach. We're partitioning the data by zipcode and ordering the house_value_min values within each group to calculate the median.

The outer SELECT statement consists of the distinct zipcodes and their respective MedianMinPrice, which can be considered an estimate of the median housing value by zipcode.

Remember that SQL dialects may vary, so please adapt the query to fit your environment. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
WITH ZipcodeHousingValue AS (
  SELECT
    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS MedianMinPrice
  FROM housing_value
  GROUP BY zipcode
)

SELECT
  zipcode,
  MedianMinPrice
FROM ZipcodeHousingValue;
```

This query calculates the median housing value directly per the SQL dialect and the available functions. However, the concept of estimation remains the same.","SELECT h.zipcode, AVG((h.house_value_min + h.house_value_max)/2) as median_house_value
FROM housing_value h
GROUP BY h.zipcode","```sql
SELECT h.zipcode, ROUND(AVG(h.house_value_min)) AS median_house_value
FROM housing_value h
GROUP BY h.zipcode
ORDER BY h.zipcode;
```","```sql

    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value
FROM
    housing_value
GROUP BY
    zipcode;
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value:** This selects the `zipcode` and calculates the median `house_value_min` for each zipcode. The `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` function returns the 50th percentile, which is the median.
* **FROM housing_value:** This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **GROUP BY zipcode:** This groups the rows by `zipcode`, allowing the median calculation to be performed for each unique zipcode.


This query will give you the median housing value for each distinct zipcode in the `housing_value` table.","To get the median housing value by zipcode, we need to first aggregate the house values by zipcode and then find the median. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value
FROM housing_value
GROUP BY zipcode;
```

This query groups the data by zipcode and uses the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function to calculate the median house value.","To find the median housing value by zipcode, we first need to write a subquery to get the median house value for each zipcode. We can use the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function to calculate the median. Then, we can use this subquery to join back to the original housing\_value table to get the zipcode. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
WITH median_house_value AS (
  SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_max) AS median_house_value
  FROM housing_value
  GROUP BY zipcode
)
SELECT m.zipcode, hv.house_value_max AS median_housing_value
FROM median_house_value m
JOIN housing_value hv ON m.zipcode = hv.zipcode
WHERE hv.house_value_max = m.median_house_value;
```

This query calculates the median of the `house_value_max` column for each zipcode, and then returns the zipcode and the median housing value. Note that we use `house_value_max` instead of `house_value_min` because the median is calculated based on the sorted values, and the provided data has a range for the housing value. Therefore, we assume that `house_value_max` will give us the actual median housing value. If you want the median of the `house_value_min` or the average of the range, you may need to adjust the query accordingly."

FROM housing_year_built
WHERE year_built_min >= 2020
GROUP BY zipcode
ORDER BY houses_built_in_or_after_2020 DESC;
```

Explanation:

- The `SELECT` statement chooses the columns to be displayed. In this case, we want to display the `zipcode` and the count of houses built in or after 2020, which we'll alias as `houses_built_in_or_after_2020`.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the table that we want to query, which is `housing_year_built`.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies a condition to filter the rows. In this case, we only want the rows where `year_built_min` is greater than or equal to 2020.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by `zipcode`, so we can calculate the count of houses for each zipcode.
- The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows in each group, effectively giving us the count of houses for each zipcode.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result by the count of houses in a descending order, so the top entries (zipcodes with the most houses) will be at the top.

Note: This query assumes that `year_built_min` refers to the range of years when the house was built (i.e., the house was built in `year_built_min`'s year). If `year_built_min` refers to the earliest year in the date range instead, replace `year_built_min` with `year_built_max` in the `WHERE` clause and the query will work as expected.","SELECT zipcode, COUNT(id)

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT zipcode, COUNT(*) AS houses_built_after_2020**: This selects the ""zipcode"" column and counts the number of rows for each zipcode, aliasing the count as ""houses_built_after_2020"".
2. **FROM housing_year_built**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
3. **WHERE year_built_min >= 2020**: This filters the data to include only houses built in or after 2020. We use `year_built_min` because it represents the earliest year a house was built within that data entry.
4. **GROUP BY zipcode**: This groups the results by zipcode, allowing us to count houses built after 2020 for each unique zipcode.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS percentage`**:
   -  This selects the calculated percentage and names it `percentage`.
   -  `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode)` counts the number of unique zipcodes.
   -  `CAST(... AS REAL)` converts the count to a real number for accurate percentage calculation.
   -  Multiplying by 100 gives the percentage. 

2. **`FROM housing_gross_rent_percent`**:
   -  Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.

3. **`WHERE year = 2022 AND GRAPI > 28`**:
   -  Filters the data to include only records from the year 2022 and where the `GRAPI` (gross rent as a percentage of income) is greater than 28%.

This query works by:

1. Selecting the count of unique zipcodes including their households having `SMOCAPI` greater than 30% (income_percent_min > 30) in the year 2022.
2. Calculating the percentage by dividing the count in step 1 by the total number of records in the year 2022 (subquery in the SELECT clause), and multiplying it by 100.0 to get the result in percentage.
3. Grouping the results by `zipcode` to ensure that we consider each unique zipcode once.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode_id)`**: This calculates the percentage.
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode)` counts the number of unique zipcodes that meet the criteria.
   -  `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode_id)` counts the total number of unique zipcodes in the table for the year 2022.
   - `CAST(... AS REAL)` converts the count to a real number for accurate percentage calculation.
   - Multiplication by 100 converts the result to a percentage.

2. **`FROM household_income_percent_with_mortgage`**: Specifies the table to query.

3. **`WHERE year = 2022 AND income_percent_max > 30`**: Filters the data to include only records from 2022 where the maximum income percentage (`income_percent_max`) is greater than 30%.



Let me know if you have any other SQL queries you need help with!","To generate the SQL query, I need to clarify a few points. Are we looking at the data for a specific zipcode or all zipcodes?

Then, we can calculate the percentage. However, based on the provided schema, there is no unique identifier for a zipcode, so we will assume that the combination of 'id' and 'zipcode' forms a unique identifier for a zipcode. Here's the SQL query to get the percentage:

```sql
WITH total_zipcodes AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(id, zipcode)) AS total_count

  WHERE year = 2022 AND income_percent_max > 30
)
SELECT qualified_count * 100.0 / total_count AS percentage
FROM total_zipcodes, qualified_zipcodes;
```

This query first calculates the total count of unique zipcodes and the count of qualified zipcodes (those having SMOCAPI > 30% in the year 2022) separately. Then, it calculates the percentage by dividing the count of qualified zipcodes by the total count. Note, the result is multiplied by 100.0 to get the percentage as a decimal number."

Note: The range condition on zipcode might be too broad for your specific needs. In this example, it is selected to include all possible Georgia zipcodes starting with '300'. You might want to adjust the condition based on the actual zipcode range in Georgia or look up geographic limits for Georgia zipcodes to ensure you're only querying records within Georgia state.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns to be retrieved:
    - `zipcode`: The zip code for each area.
    - `male_ratio`:  Calculates the percentage of males within each zip code.
    - `female_ratio`: Calculates the percentage of females within each zip code.

2. **FROM**: This clause indicates the table from which the data is fetched: `demographic_basics`.

3. **WHERE**: This clause filters the results based on the specified conditions:
    - `year = 2022`: Retrieves data for the year 2022.
    - `zipcode LIKE '30%'`: Filters for zip codes in Georgia, assuming they start with '30'.

4. **Calculations**:
    - The expressions `(total_population_male / total_population) * 100` and `(total_population_female / total_population) * 100` calculate the male and female ratios as percentages.


Remember to modify the `zipcode LIKE '30%'` part if the zip code format in Georgia is different.","To generate the SQL query for this request, I'll need to know the specific year you're interested in. You mentioned 2022, correct?","Here is a SQL query to fulfill your request:

This query will return the zipcode and the gender ratio (calculated as the number of males divided by the number of females) for each zipcode in the state of Georgia for the year 2022. Note that I am assuming that the table has a column called `state` that stores the state abbreviation for each entry. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the query accordingly.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT zipcode, (native_hawaiian_and_other_pacific_islander_total / race_total_population) * 100 AS percentage`**: This selects the `zipcode` and calculates the percentage.

   -  `native_hawaiian_and_other_pacific_islander_total`: This column stores the total population of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander in a zip code.
   - `race_total_population`: This column stores the total population for which race information is available in a zip code.
   - The calculation divides the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population by the total race population and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.
   - `AS percentage`: This names the calculated percentage column as `percentage`.

2. **`FROM demographic_race`**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **`WHERE year = 2022`**: This filters the data to include only records for the year 2022.

4. **`GROUP BY zipcode`**: This groups the results by `zipcode`, allowing you to calculate the percentage for each zip code separately.



This query will give you a result set with two columns: `zipcode` and `percentage`, showing the percentage of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander people in each zip code for the year 2022.","To generate the SQL query, I need to know the specific year you're interested in.

   - `percent_change`: Calculates the percentage difference in car-alone commuters between 2019 and 2022.
2. **((SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN car_alone ELSE 0 END) / SUM(total_workers) * 100) - ... ):**  
   - This part calculates the percentage of car-alone commuters for each year:
     - `CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN car_alone ELSE 0 END`: If the year is 2022, take the `car_alone` value, otherwise, take 0.
     - `SUM(...)`: Sums up the `car_alone` values for each year.
     - `SUM(total_workers)`: Gets the total number of workers in each zipcode.
     - `/`: Divides the summed `car_alone` by the total workers to get the percentage.
     - `* 100`: Multiplies by 100 to convert the percentage to a whole number.
   - The final calculation subtracts the percentage from 2019 from the percentage in 2022 to get the percentage change.
3. **FROM economic_commute_to_work:** Specifies the table to query.
4. **WHERE year IN (2019, 2022) AND zipcode LIKE '30%':**  
   - Filters the data to include only years 2019 and 2022.
   - Filters for zipcodes that start with '30' assuming these are Atlanta zipcodes.
5. **GROUP BY zipcode:** Groups the results by each unique zipcode to calculate the percentage change for each zipcode.

```
This query calculates the change in percentage of those traveling in car alone between the years 2019 and 2022 for each zipcode in Atlanta. It first selects the `zipcode`, `car_alone` column for the year 2019, and a subquery is used to get the `car_alone` column for the year 2022. Then it calculates the change in percentage by subtracting the `car_alone` of 2019 from the `car_alone` of 2022, and dividing the result by `car_alone` of 2019.

Note that I am assuming the table `economic_commute_to_work` contains a column with the name ""city"" to filter the data for the city Atlanta, if not, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.

Also, Note that this query assumes that the car\_alone column will have a value for each zipcode at both 2019 and 2022 if not this query will return NULL values, you can adjust the where clause accordingly."

This query uses the `LIKE` operator to select only zipcodes that start with ""30"", which are in Georgia. It then calculates the average mean travel time for 2017 and 2022 separately, and subtracts the 2017 average from the 2022 average to get the change in mean commute time.

Note that this query assumes that there are no missing values for the `mean_travel_time` column. If there are missing values, you might want to consider excluding those rows from the calculation using the `WHERE` clause.

Another assumption made by this query is that the `year` column is of type `integer` or `smallint`. If it is of a different data type, the `WHERE` clause and the `FILTER` clauses might need to be adjusted accordingly."

   - **pct_wfh_2022:** Calculates the percentage of work-from-home employees in 2022 for each zip code.
   - **pct_change:**  Calculates the percentage change between 2019 and 2022.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - Specifies the `economic_commute_to_work` table as the source of data.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - `zipcode LIKE '30%'`: Filters the data to include only zip codes starting with '30', which typically represent Atlanta.

4. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - Groups the results by `zipcode` to calculate the percentage change for each unique zip code.

5. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   - Sorts the results in descending order based on `pct_change`, showing the zip codes with the highest percentage change first.



Let me know if you need help adjusting this query for a specific subset of data or need further clarification on any part of it.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the specific zipcodes in Atlanta you're interested in. Could you provide those?","To get the change in percentage of those working from home between year 2019 and 2022 for each zipcode in Atlanta, you can use the following SQL query:

It then performs a subquery to get the number of people working from home in both 2019 and 2022 for each of these zipcodes. Finally, it calculates the change in percentage and returns the results.

Note: I am making the assumption that the `city` column exists in the `economic_commute_to_work` table and contains the name of the city for each zipcode. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the query to correctly select the zipcodes for Atlanta.

Also note that this query will only work if there are rows in the table for both 2019 and 2022 for each of the zipcodes in Atlanta. If this is not the case, you will need to handle the missing data appropriately (e.g. by using a `LEFT JOIN` instead of a subquery)."

This query does the following:

1. **Filters the data**: It starts by selecting only the data for the year 2022 using the `WHERE` clause.
2. **Calculates percentages**: For each commute type, it calculates the percentage by:
   - Summing the `total_workers` for that commute type 
   - Dividing the sum by the total sum of `total_workers` for the year
   - Multiplying by 100 to get the percentage
3. **Groups the results**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `commute_type`, so you get one row for each commute type with its corresponding percentage.

**Please note:** This query assumes your `commute_to_work` table has a column named `commute_type`. If your column name is different, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.

This query will return the zipcode along with the percentage of workers who commute using each type of transportation. Note that if the `total_workers` field can contain null values, you may want to use a `COALESCE` function to replace any null values with `0` before performing the division.

Here is an example of how you could use the `COALESCE` function:
```
SELECT

  (car_alone * 100.0 / COALESCE(total_workers, 1)) AS car_alone_percent,

* **`PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY median_household_income) AS median_income`**: This calculates the median `median_household_income` for each year. `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` represents the 50th percentile, which is the median. 
* **`FROM economic_income_and_benefits`**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **`GROUP BY year`**: This groups the data by year, allowing us to calculate aggregate values for each year.

3. **(units_without_mortgage * 100.0 / (units_with_mortgage + units_without_mortgage)) AS no_mortgage_percentage**: This calculates the percentage of households without mortgages for each year, using a similar logic.
4. **FROM housing_mortgage**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
5. **GROUP BY year**: This groups the results by year so that we get separate percentages for each year.



This query will give you a table with two new columns: `mortgage_percentage` and `no_mortgage_percentage`, showing the breakdown of households with and without mortgages for each year in your data.","To get the percentage of households with and without mortgage for each year, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql

FROM 
    housing_mortgage
ORDER BY 
    year, category;
```

```
This query calculates the percentage of households with and without a mortgage for each year by averaging the percentage of households with a mortgage and without a mortgage for each zip code in a given year. The `ROUND` function is used to round the percentage values to two decimal places.

Note: This query assumes that the `units_with_mortgage` and `units_without_mortgage` columns represent the number of households with and without a mortgage, respectively, in a given zip code and year. If these columns represent something else, the query will need to be modified accordingly."

   * Each CTE calculates the average median household income for a given year (2017 or 2022) grouped by `zipcode`.

2. **JOIN:**
   * We join the two CTEs on the `zipcode` column to ensure we are comparing the average income for the same zipcodes across the years.

3. **Calculation:**
   *  We subtract the average median income from 2017 (`i2017.avg_median_income_2017`) from the average median income from 2022 (`i2022.avg_median_income_2022`) to get the `change_avg_median_income`.

```
This query first filters the table to only include rows from the years 2017 and 2022. Then, for each zipcode, it calculates the average median household income for those two years. Finally, it subtracts the average for 2017 from the average for 2022 to get the change in income.

Note that this query uses the `FILTER` clause, which is available in PostgreSQL and some other database systems. If you are using a different database system that does not support `FILTER`, you can achieve the same result using a subquery instead.

Also note that this query assumes that the `median_household_income` column contains the median household income, not the mean. If it contains the mean, you should use `mean_household_income` instead in the query."

The `WHERE` clause filters the data to only include zipcodes from Georgia (assuming the first digit of Georgia zipcodes is 3). The `PERCENTILE_CONT` function is used to calculate the median household income. Note that this function is available in some databases, but not all. If it is not available in your database, you may need to use a different approach to calculate the median.

Also, please note that in some databases, the syntax for the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function may be slightly different. For example, in MySQL, you can use the `PERCENTILE` function instead.

Here is an example of how you can calculate the median using the `PERCENTILE` function in MySQL:

It then groups the remaining rows by zipcode and calculates the sum of the `foreign_born_population` and `not_a_us_citizen` columns for each group, giving the total foreign-born population and non-US citizen count for each zipcode.

Note that the `REGEXP` operator is used to match the regular expression pattern for the zipcode values. This operator is specific to certain SQL databases, such as MySQL. If you are using a different database, you may need to use a different method to match the zipcode pattern.

Also note that the query does not filter the rows based on the year column. If you want to include only rows with a specific year or range of years, you can add a condition to the `WHERE` clause to specify that. For example, to include only rows with a year value of 2015, you can add the condition `year = 2015` to the `WHERE` clause.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT clause:**
   - `year`: Selects the year column.
   - `race`: Selects the race column.
   - `AVG(race_total_populatio) AS average_population`: Calculates the average of the `race_total_population` for each group and aliases it as `average_population`.

2. **FROM clause:** Specifies the table to query, which is `demographic_race`.

3. **WHERE clause:** Filters the data to include only records where the `race` column is one of 'black', 'white', or 'asian'.

4. **GROUP BY clause:** Groups the results by `year` and `race`, so the average is calculated for each combination.

5. **ORDER BY clause:** Orders the results first by `year` and then by `race` for better readability.

1. **WITH EducationPercentages AS:** This creates a common table expression (CTE) named ""EducationPercentages"" to simplify the calculation logic.

2. **Calculate percentages:** We calculate each education type percentage by dividing the corresponding column by `population_25_years_and_over` and multiplying by 100. We use `CAST` to convert the result to a REAL data type for accurate percentages.

3. **SELECT:** The main query selects all the calculated percentages and groups them by `year`.

4. **ORDER BY:** The results are ordered by `year` for easy readability.
