ORDER BY FIELD(Day_Occurred, 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')
```

This query will retrieve the total number of crimes that occurred in Atlanta for each day of the week. The `GROUP BY` clause will group the results by the day of the week, and the `COUNT(*)` function will count the number of occurrences for each group. The `ORDER BY` clause will sort the results in the order of the days of the week.","SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM Crime_Date) as Day_Of_Week, COUNT(*) as Total_Crimes_Occurred

```","```sql
SELECT DayOfWeek(Crime_Date) as Day, COUNT(Crime_ID) as TotalCrimes

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DayOfWeek(Crime_Date) as Day`**: This extracts the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column and names it as ""Day"".
2. **`COUNT(Crime_ID) as TotalCrimes`**: This counts the number of crimes for each day.
3. **`FROM atlanta_crime_data`**: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
4. **`GROUP BY Day`**: Groups the results by the extracted day of the week.
5. **`ORDER BY Day`**: Orders the results in ascending order of the day of the week.

This query uses the `DATE_FORMAT()` function to extract the day of the week (as a string) from the `Crime_Date` column. It then groups the results by this day-of-the-week value and counts the number of rows in each group.

Note that the `%W` format specifier used in `DATE_FORMAT()` will give you the day of the week as a full name (e.g. 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.). If you want the day of the week as a number (e.g. 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.), you can use the `%w` format specifier instead.

Also note that this query assumes that the `Crime_Date` column contains valid date values. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.",-1,0.7173284259999946,0.5666666666666668,0.2838137472283814,"```sql

This query extracts the month from the ```Crime_Date``` column, counts the total number of crimes that occurred within each month, filters only the entries where ```Area_Name``` is 'Atlanta', groups the results by month, and sorts them in ascending order based on the month. The output will show the total crimes occurred in Atlanta for each month of the year in the form of a table with two columns: 'Month' and 'Total_Crimes'.","SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH from Crime_Date) as Month, COUNT(*) as Total_Crimes

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%Y-%m', Crime_Date)`:** This creates a new column named `CrimeMonth` by extracting the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column and formatting it as 'YYYY-MM'.
2. **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`:** Counts the number of crimes for each month and names the resulting column `TotalCrimes`.
3. **`WHERE strftime('%Y', Crime_Date) = '2020'`:** Filters the data to only include crimes from the year 2020. You can change the year as needed.
4. **`GROUP BY CrimeMonth`:** Groups the results by month, so the count is calculated for each unique month.
5. **`ORDER BY CrimeMonth`:** Orders the final result set chronologically by month.

SELECT 
  YEARWEEK(Crime_Date, 3) /* Use MySQL mode 3 to start week on Monday */,
  COUNT(*)
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Crime_Date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY YEARWEEK(Crime_Date, 3)
ORDER BY Crime_Date;
```

This will give you the total count of crimes in Atlanta grouped by week, starting from January 2009. The `YEARWEEK` function takes a date and a mode as input, and returns the year and week number. Using mode 3 tells MySQL to start counting weeks from the first Monday following the start of the year, which makes it compatible with our request to group by week.

Please modify this query according to your DBMS as not all DBMSes use the same week starting day. For example, SQLite uses Sunday as the first day of the week by default, so you don't need to pass any mode to it. For PostgreSQL, you can simply use the `date_trunc` function as they don't define the first day of the week as their behavior varies across different locales.

For PostgreSQL, this should do the trick:

```sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('week', Crime_Date)::date,
  COUNT(*)
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Crime_Date >= '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY date_trunc('week', Crime_Date)::date

GROUP BY
    WeekNumber
ORDER BY
    WeekNumber;
```

**Explanation:**

* **`strftime('%W', Crime_Date) AS WeekNumber`**:  This extracts the week number from the `Crime_Date` column using the `strftime` function. '%W' is the format code for the week number (00-53).
* **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`**: This counts the total number of crimes for each week.
* **`WHERE strftime('%Y', Crime_Date) >= '2009'`**:  This filters the data to include only crimes from January 2009 onwards.
* **`GROUP BY WeekNumber`**: This groups the results by the calculated week number.
* **`ORDER BY WeekNumber`**: This sorts the results in ascending order of week number.

FROM 
  la_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'Los Angeles'
GROUP BY 
  Day_Of_Week
ORDER BY 
  Day_Of_Week;
```

This query selects the day of the week from the 'Crime_Date' column using the `DAYOFWEEK()` function and counts the number of occurrences using `COUNT(*)`. This result is grouped by the day of the week and ordered by the day of the week. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter crimes that occurred in the Los Angeles area. Note that you may need to adjust the query depending on the specifics of your database setup and data types. The `DAYOFWEEK()` function returns an integer representing the day of the week, where Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, ..., Saturday = 7. You may want to use the `DAYNAME()` function instead if you prefer the day name instead of the day index.","SELECT DATE(Crime_Date) as Day_Of_Week, COUNT(*) as Total_Crimes

```

This query does the following:

1. **Selects:**
   - `DAYNAME(Crime_Date)`:  Extracts the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"") from the `Crime_Date` column and aliases it as `DayOfWeek`.
   - `COUNT(Crime_ID)`: Counts the number of crimes for each day.

2. **From:** `la_crime_data`: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **Group By:** `DayOfWeek`: Groups the results by the day of the week, so we get a count for each day.

4. **Order By:** `DayOfWeek`: Sorts the results alphabetically by day of the week.



Let me know if you have any other SQL requests!","To fulfill the request, I'll need to aggregate the crimes by day of the week.

  la_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'LA'

```
This query will group the `la_crime_data` table by the day of the week (using the `DATEPART` function with the `dw` argument to extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column), and count the number of crimes for each group. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include crimes that occurred in LA (you would need to replace `'LA'` with the actual area name in your data if it is different).

Note: The `DATEPART` function and the `dw` argument are specific to SQL Server. If you are using a different SQL database, you may need to use a different function or syntax to extract the day of the week from a date. For example, in MySQL you can use the `DAYOFWEEK` function, and in PostgreSQL you can use the `EXTRACT` function with the `DOW` argument.",-1,1.1523946349999505,0.576271186440678,0.26150121065375304,"```sql

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', Crime_Date) AS CrimeMonth`**:
   - Extracts the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column using the `strftime` function.
   - Formats the date as 'YYYY-MM' and aliases it as `CrimeMonth`.

2. **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`**:
   - Counts the total number of crimes for each month.
   - Aliases the count as `TotalCrimes`.

3. **`FROM la_crime_data`**:
   - Specifies the table to query.

4. **`GROUP BY CrimeMonth`**:
   - Groups the results by the extracted month, allowing us to count crimes per month.

5. **`ORDER BY CrimeMonth`**:
   - Sorts the results chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%W', Date_Reported) AS WeekNumber`:** 
   - `strftime('%W', Date_Reported)` extracts the week number (0-52) from the `Date_Reported` column using the `strftime` function.
   - This is aliased as `WeekNumber` for clarity.

2. **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`:** Counts all rows within each week group and aliases the result as `TotalCrimes`.

3. **`GROUP BY WeekNumber`:** Groups the results by the calculated `WeekNumber`.

4. **`ORDER BY WeekNumber`:** Sorts the results in ascending order of the week number.

    COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes  -- Count the number of crimes
FROM nyc_crime_data
GROUP BY DayOfWeek; 
```


**Explanation:**

* **`SELECT DAYNAME(Crime_Date) AS DayOfWeek`**: This part extracts the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column using the `DAYNAME()` function and names it `DayOfWeek`.
* **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`**:  This counts all the rows for each day and labels the count as `TotalCrimes`.
* **`FROM nyc_crime_data`**: Specifies the table from which we're retrieving data.
* **`GROUP BY DayOfWeek`**:  Groups the results by the `DayOfWeek`, so we get a count of crimes for each day.


Let me know if you have any other SQL query requests!","To fulfill the request, I need to know the specific date range you're interested in. Could you provide that?","To get the total crimes that occurred in New York on each day of the week from the `nyc_crime_data` table, you can use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%W') AS Day_Of_Week, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM 
  nyc_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'New York'
GROUP BY 
  Day_Of_Week;
```
This query uses the `DATE_FORMAT()` function to extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column, and then groups the results by the day of the week. The `COUNT()` function is used to count the number of crimes that occurred on each day of the week.

Note that I assumed that the `Area_Name` column contains the value 'New York' to identify the crimes that occurred in New York. If the area names in your table are more specific (e.g. 'Bronx', 'Queens', etc.), you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Also, the date format string `'%W'` used in the `DATE_FORMAT()` function will return the day of the week as a full name (e.g. 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.). If you want to return the day of the week as a number (e.g. 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.), you can use the format string `'%u'` instead.

Here is an example of how the query would work using the data you provided:

| Day\_Of\_Week | Total\_Crimes |
| --- | --- |
| Thursday | 1 |
| Friday | 1 |
| Saturday | 1 |
| Sunday | 1 |

2. **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`**: This counts the number of rows for each `CrimeMonth` group, giving us the total crimes for each month.
3. **`FROM nyc_crime_data`**: This specifies the table where our data is stored.

FROM

```

Explanation:

1. The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM STR_TO_DATE(Crime_Time, '%I:%i %p')) AS Crime_Hour` part extracts the hour part of the Crime_Time field and aliases it as Crime_Hour. Note that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using STR_TO_DATE to convert Crime_Time to a proper time value.

2. `COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes` gets the total number of crimes that occur at each hour.

3. The `WHERE Area_Name = 'NEW YORK'` clause filters only the crimes that occur in ""New York"".

4. The `GROUP BY Crime_Hour` clause groups the result set based on each hour of the day.

5. The `ORDER BY Crime_Hour` clause sorts the result according to the hour of the day.

Please note that the format of the Crime_Time field is not provided in the provided table structure. The example assumes a US format like ""02:00 PM"". The STR_TO_DATE portion of the query will need to be adapted if the format of Crime_Time differs.
Note that SQL functions and syntax could differ based on the SQL database engine you're using (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.). So this specific query may need to be adapted accordingly.","SELECT Time, COUNT(*) as Total_Crimes

SELECT strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`**: This selects the hour from the `Crime_Time` column and counts the total number of crimes for each hour.  
    * `strftime('%H', Crime_Time)` extracts the hour value (00-23) from the `Crime_Time` column.
    * `COUNT(*)` counts all rows within each hour group.
    * `AS Hour` and `AS TotalCrimes` give meaningful names to the resulting columns.
2. **`FROM nyc_crime_data`**: Specifies the table to query.
3. **`WHERE Area_Name = 'New York'`**: Filters the data to include only crimes committed in New York City.
4. **`GROUP BY Hour`**: Groups the results by the extracted hour, allowing us to count crimes per hour.
5. **`ORDER BY Hour`**: Orders the results chronologically by hour.

Note that I am assuming that the `Area_Name` column contains the value 'New York' for crimes that occurred in the city of New York. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the query accordingly.

Also note that the `%l` format specifier in the `DATE_FORMAT` function returns the hour as a 12-hour value (e.g. ""1"" for 1:00 AM, ""2"" for 2:00 PM). If you want the hour to be returned as a 24-hour value, you can use the `%H` format specifier instead.

Let me know if you have any other SQL queries you need help with!","To fulfill your request, I'll need to aggregate the crimes by day of the week.

```
SELECT DATE(Crime_Date) AS Date, COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes

This query will select the date of each crime from the `philly_crime_data` table and count the number of crimes that occurred on each date. The results will be grouped by date and ordered in ascending order.

However, if you want to see the total crimes for each day of the week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.), you will need to use the `WEEKDAY()` function in MySQL to extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column and then group the results by that value. Here is an example of how you can do that:
```
SELECT WEEKDAY(Crime_Date) AS Day_Of_Week, COUNT(*) AS Total_Crimes
FROM philly_crime_data

```
This query will extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column and group the results by that value. The results will be ordered in ascending order by day of the week, so you will see the total crimes for each day of the week starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday.

Please note that the `WEEKDAY()` function returns a value between 0 and 6, with 0 representing Sunday and 6 representing Saturday. If you want to see the day of the week as a text value (e.g. ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", etc.), you can use a `CASE` statement to convert the numeric values returned by `WEEKDAY()` to text values. Here is an example of how you can do that:

```
Month       | Total_Crimes
---------------------------

```

This query will display the total number of crimes that occurred each month in the given data. The `DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%Y-%m')` function extracts the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column, and the `COUNT(*)` function sums up the total number of rows for each month. The results are ordered by month to provide a more structured view.

**Explanation:**

* **`strftime('%Y-%m', Crime_Date) AS crime_month`**: Extracts the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column and formats it as ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2024-02""). This creates a new column called `crime_month` to group the data by month.
* **`COUNT(*) AS total_crimes`**: Counts the number of rows for each unique `crime_month`, representing the total crimes in that month.
* **`GROUP BY crime_month`**: Groups the rows based on the `crime_month` column. This ensures that we get a count of crimes for each distinct month.
* **`ORDER BY crime_month`**: Orders the results chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour, COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Total_Crimes`**: This selects the hour from the `Crime_Time` column using the `strftime` function (which extracts specific parts of a date or time) and aliases it as ""Hour"". It also counts the number of crimes (`Crime_ID`) for each hour and aliases it as ""Total_Crimes"".

2. **`FROM philly_crime_data`**: This specifies the table we're querying data from.

3. **`WHERE AREA_# = 'Philly'`**: This filters the data to include only crimes that occurred in Philadelphia (assuming 'Philly' is the appropriate area code). Adjust this condition if your data uses a different column name or format for location information.

4. **`GROUP BY Hour`**: This groups the results by the extracted ""Hour"" value, so we get a count of crimes for each hour.

5. **`ORDER BY Hour`**: This orders the results chronologically by hour, making it easier to analyze the crime trends throughout the day.

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%W', Crime_Date) AS Week`:**
   - This part of the query extracts the week number from the `Crime_Date` column using the `strftime` function.  
   - `%W` is the format code for representing the week of the year (0-53). 
   - It then aliases this extracted week number as `Week`.

2. **`COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimes`:**
   - This counts the total number of crime records for each week.
   - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in each week group.
   - The result is aliased as `TotalCrimes`.

3. **`FROM philly_crime_data`:** 
   - This specifies the table from which the data is being retrieved.

4. **`GROUP BY Week`:**
   - This groups the crime records by the extracted `Week` number, so we get a count for each distinct week.

5. **`ORDER BY Week`:**
   - This orders the final result set by the week number, making the output easy to read and analyze.

GROUP BY LatitudeRange, LongitudeRange, Crime_Type

```

This query creates groups in latitudinal and longitudinal steps of 0.01 degrees and calculates the most common crime type within each group, along with the count of crimes for that type.

Note that the `LIMIT 1` clause will only return one row; you would need to remove or adjust it if you need more than one group result. Additionally, this query will return only the most common crime for the very first group (the one with the smallest latitude and longitude range) among the ordered groupings; if you want to get the most common crimes for all the groups, you would need to use a window function, which is not supported in all database platforms.

If the original question is aiming to return the most common crime for each group, here is an alternative using a window function called `ROW_NUMBER()`:

```sql
WITH ranked_crimes AS (
  SELECT 
    FLOOR(latitude / 0.01) * 0.01 AS LatitudeRange,

**Explanation:**

1. **`crime_grid` CTE:**
   - Calculates the count of each crime type for each unique latitude and longitude combination.

2. **`grouped_crimes` CTE:**
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to assign a rank to each crime type within each latitude-longitude group, ordered by the crime count in descending order.

3. **Final `SELECT` statement:**
   - Selects the latitude, longitude, crime type, and count from `grouped_crimes` 
   - Filters the results to only include the row with the highest rank (`rn = 1`), effectively retrieving the most common crime type for each unique location.
   - Orders the results by latitude and longitude for better visualization.

**Important Notes:**

- This query assumes that you want the most common crime type based on the raw count, not necessarily the proportion of crimes.

- The `0.01 degrees` spacing is not explicitly enforced in the query. You would need to decide how to group your data into bins based on that spacing based on your specific needs and the data granularity.

  AND Longitude BETWEEN -84.412846 + 0.01 AND -84.301414 - 0.01
GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude
```

Why this query works:

- I've selected the Latitude, Longitude and the count of total crimes for each set of (Latitude, Longitude) pair.

- The WHERE clause is used to filter data that is in the range of 32.35888 to 33.77476 in Latitude and -84.412846 to -84.301414 in Longitude. We are modifying the values of latitude and longitude with a decrease of 0.01.

- The GROUP BY clause groups the selected records by Latitude and Longitude so that we can calculate the total crime count for each coordinate.

NOTE: This query assumes that the latitude and longitude values are in decimal format. If the values are in degrees format, they would not relate as expected, and modifications would be required to convert the degrees.","```sql
SELECT ROUND(latitude, 2), ROUND(longitude, 2), COUNT(*)
FROM atlanta_crime_data
WHERE Area_Name = 'Atlanta'
GROUP BY ROUND(latitude, 2), ROUND(longitude, 2)
ORDER BY ROUND(latitude, 2), ROUND(longitude, 2);
```","```sql
-- Calculate crime counts for each coordinate spaced by 0.01 degrees in latitude and longitude

SELECT
    ROUND(latitude, 2) AS lat,  -- Round latitude to two decimal places
    ROUND(longitude, 2) AS lon,  -- Round longitude to two decimal places
    COUNT(DISTINCT Crime_ID) AS total_crime_count
FROM
    atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY
    lat, lon
ORDER BY
    lat, lon;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT ROUND(latitude, 2) AS lat, ROUND(longitude, 2) AS lon`**:
   - This selects the latitude and longitude columns and rounds them to two decimal places for grouping.

2. **`COUNT(DISTINCT Crime_ID) AS total_crime_count`**:
   - This counts the distinct Crime_ID values for each latitude-longitude combination, effectively giving the total crime count.

3. **`FROM atlanta_crime_data`**:
   - This specifies the table to retrieve data from.

4. **`GROUP BY lat, lon`**:
   - This groups the results by the rounded latitude and longitude, aggregating crimes for each coordinate.
 
5. **`ORDER BY lat, lon`**:
   - This orders the results by latitude and longitude, making it easier to visualize the crime distribution.



Let me know if you have any other SQL query requests!","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific requirements.

This query will select the rounded longitude and latitude values (to 2 decimal places) and count the number of crimes within each coordinate. The longitude and latitude values are restricted to the range of coordinates for Atlanta spaced by 0.01 degrees.

Note that I have assumed that the longitude and latitude values are stored as floating point numbers, and that 33.75, -84.5 are the central coordinates for Atlanta. You may need to adjust the central coordinates and spacing as needed.

This query starts by calculating floating-point latitude and longitude bins for the given crime data. A bin is created by rounding down the latitude and longitude to a certain decimal place, in this case, two decimal places for a resolution of 0.01 degrees. Then it counts the number of crimes in each bin and groups results by 'Lat_Bin' and 'Long_Bin'. The query uses `FLOOR` combined with mathematical operations to formulate the bin ranges for latitude and longitude.

The query's result will provide the total crime count for each latitude&longitude pair, with intervals of 0.01 degrees, in addition to allowing customization of the desired density of data points by small increments in the result.

Please note that this query will generate multiple bins for each coordinate, each with a width of 0.01 degrees. Depending on the data distribution, a significant portion of the data may be included in the first few larger bins.

The query creates a grid table using the generate_series() function and then applies the get_grid_id() function to calculate the grid index for each latitude and longitude. The spatial join between the input data and the grid is then done using ST_Contains() function. The query then groups the data by grid cell and crime type and returns the most common crime type and its count.

Note: You might need to adjust the parameters in the derived tables, get_grid_id() function, and ST_Contains() function to match your needs.

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression):** We use a CTE named `CrimeDensity` to pre-calculate the count of each crime type at each latitude-longitude pair.

2. **Filtering by LA Area:** The `WHERE` clause within the `CrimeDensity` CTE ensures we are only considering locations within the general area of Los Angeles.

3. **Aggregation and Sorting:** 
   - The outer `SELECT` statement retrieves the Latitude, Longitude, Crime_Type, and the aggregated `CrimeCount`.
   - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by these columns, effectively finding the most frequent crime type at each unique location.
   - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by Latitude and Longitude for easier analysis.

4. **Spaced by 0.01 Degrees:** The `WHERE` clause `Latitude BETWEEN 33.9 and 34.1 AND Longitude BETWEEN 118.1 and 118.4` roughly defines the region, you can adjust the boundaries to precisely target the area you're interested in within LA. This effectively groups data with latitude and longitude separated by 0.01 degrees as the query will only return results within those specified boundaries.

**Note:**  The specific location boundaries might need adjustments depending on the exact area of LA you want to analyze.","To fulfill your request, I'll need to generate a query that aggregates crime data by latitude and longitude with a specific granularity.

nyc_crime_data_with_coordinates (Crime_ID, Report_#, Crime_Date, Crime_Time, Crime_Class, Crime_Type, Area_Name, Latitude, Longitude)

Then the SQL query would be:

```
SELECT
  FLOOR(Latitude*100)/100 AS Latitude,
  FLOOR(Longitude*100)/100 AS Longitude,
  COUNT(*) AS crime_count
FROM nyc_crime_data_with_coordinates
GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude
ORDER BY Latitude, Longitude
```

This query will return the total crime count for each coordinate in latitude and longitude, spaced by 0.01 degrees.

However, given the constraints and schema as mentioned in the source, it is not possible to provide an SQL query to handle this scenario.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Latitude, Longitude, COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimeCount:** This line specifies that we want to fetch the latitude, longitude, and the count of crimes for each unique coordinate. We alias the count as `TotalCrimeCount`.

2. **FROM nyc_crime_data:** This line indicates the table we are querying.

3. **WHERE Latitude BETWEEN 40.80 AND 40.90 AND Longitude BETWEEN -74.00 AND -73.70:** This line filters the data to include only records within the desired latitude and longitude range for New York City. You'll need to adjust these values to accurately cover your desired area.

4. **GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude:** This line groups the results by unique latitude and longitude combinations, allowing us to count crimes for each coordinate.

5. **HAVING Latitude < 40.91;:** This line filters out any coordinates with a latitude greater than or equal to 40.91 to avoid  duplicates.




This query iterates through all possible latitude and longitude combinations spaced by 0.01 degrees within the specified range. For each combination, it counts the number of crimes reported at that location.

**Important Notes:**

* **Adjust the Latitude and Longitude Range:** Set the appropriate boundaries for your desired geographic area in New York City. 
*  **Coordinate System:** Make sure the latitude and longitude values in your `nyc_crime_data` table are stored in a consistent format (e.g., degrees, decimal degrees).
*  **Performance:** For very large datasets, this query might be computationally expensive. Consider indexing the `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns for better performance. You could also explore using geospatial indexing techniques offered by some database systems.","To generate the SQL query, I need to understand the specific range of latitude and longitude you're interested in for New York. Could you provide the starting and ending coordinates?","Here's an SQL query that should give you the desired result. However, please note that this query might not perform well on a large dataset due to the use of a subquery for generating the grid.

```sql

GROUP BY
  g.grid_latitude, g.grid_longitude;
```

This query first creates a grid of latitude and longitude values spaced by 0.01 degrees. Then, it counts the number of crimes within each grid cell by joining the grid with the `nyc_crime_data` table.

Please note that I added a condition `WHERE Area_Name = 'BRONX'` to limit the data to a specific area. You can remove this condition if you want data from all areas.

In this query, we use the ROUND() function to round the latitude and longitude to the nearest third decimal place (0.01 degrees). Then, we group by the rounded latitude, rounded longitude, and the crime type. Finally, we count the occurrences of each crime type and order the results by the count in descending order.

You need to replace `@minutesInDegrees` with the appropriate calculation to convert 0.01 degrees to minutes. For latitude and longitude:

```sql
DECLARE @minutesInDegrees DECIMAL(7, 5) = 0.01 * 4;  -- multiply by 4 since there are 4 minutes in 0.01 degree

**Explanation:**

1. **`DegreeGrid` CTE:**
   - Creates a temporary table called `DegreeGrid` to count crimes within each 0.01 degree latitude/longitude grid.
   - The `WHERE` clause limits the area to New York City. Adjust the latitude and longitude bounds (`40.67`, `40.93`, `-74.08`, `-73.73`) for your specific region of interest.
   - `GROUP BY Latitude, Longitude` groups crimes by their coordinates.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Joins the `DegreeGrid` CTE with the original `nyc_crime_data` table using `Latitude` and `Longitude` to combine crime count information with individual crime types.
   - `GROUP BY dg.Latitude, dg.Longitude, ct.Crime_Type` groups the data by coordinate and crime type within each grid.
   - `COUNT(ct.Crime_Type)` counts the occurrences of each crime type within each grid.
   - `ORDER BY dg.Latitude, dg.Longitude` presents the results in an ordered manner by latitude and longitude.



**To Get the Most Common Crime Type:**

- You'll need to use a `CASE WHEN` statement within the `SELECT` clause to identify the most frequent crime type for each grid and then display it along with its count.

- `COUNT(*) as TotalCrimeCount` calculates the total number of crimes for each group of coordinates.
- `HAVING FLOOR(Latitude) - (-90) BETWEEN (-90 - 0.01) AND -90` and `FLOOR(Latitude) - (-90) BETWEEN -90 AND (-90 + 0.01)` ensures that we only get coordinates in Philadelphia by filtering out ones outside the valid ranges.

   - Groups the rows based on unique combinations of latitude and longitude.

4. **`HAVING latitude BETWEEN 39.90 AND 39.98 AND longitude BETWEEN 75.05 AND 75.20`**:
   - Filters the grouped results to include only coordinates within the specified latitude and longitude range for Philadelphia. You'll need to adjust these bounds based on the specific area you're interested in.

5. **`ORDER BY latitude, longitude`**:
   - Sorts the results alphabetically by latitude and then longitude, making it easier to see the spatial distribution of crime counts.

**Explanation:**

1. **WITH CTE:** We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `CrimeGrid`.
   - It groups crimes by rounded latitude, longitude, and crime type.
   - It calculates the count of each crime type within each 0.01-degree spatial bin.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Selects latitude, longitude, crime type, and count from the `CrimeGrid` CTE.
   - Groups the results again by latitude, longitude, and crime type. This ensures we get the most common crime type for each grid cell.
   - Orders the results by latitude and longitude for easier visualization.

3. **LIMIT:** The `LIMIT 10` is for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would likely remove this or adjust it to return all relevant data.



**Important Notes:**

- **Accuracy:**  
Rounding latitude and longitude to 2 decimal places (0.01 degree accuracy) may not perfectly capture all crime data distribution. You can adjust the rounding precision (e.g., `ROUND(Latitude, 4)`) if needed.

- **Data Volume:** If your dataset is very large, you might need to optimize the query for performance. Consider using indexes on `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns.

- **Area Selection:**
 This query assumes you want to analyze all of Philadelphia. If you need to focus on a specific area, add a `WHERE` clause to filter based on `Area_#` based on the `Area_#` column.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific requirements.

3. **FROM atlanta_crime_data**: This indicates the table we are querying.
4. **GROUP BY Crime_Type**: This groups the rows based on the unique values in the ""Crime_Type"" column. 


This will result in a table showing each unique crime type and the total number of crimes of that type in the atlanta_crime_data table.","To fulfill the request, I'll need to count the occurrences of each crime type in the Atlanta crime data.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`WeeklyCrimeCounts` CTE:**
   - Calculates the count of crimes for each `Crime_Type` within each week, defined by `DATE_TRUNC('week', Crime_Date)`.

2. **`LastReportedInfo` CTE:**
   - Finds the `LastReportedDate` and `LastReportedArea` for each `Crime_Type` by using `MAX()` on those columns.

3. **`MostCommonArea` CTE:**
   - Determines the most common area for each `Crime_Type` using `RANK()` - areas with the highest count get rank '1'.

4. **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
   - Joins the three CTEs to get the desired information. 
   - Groups the results by `Crime_Type`, `LastReportedDate`, `LastReportedArea`, and `MostCommonArea` to aggregate data.

**Important Notes:**


* **Calculate Weekly Percentage Increase:**  You'll need to add logic to calculate the weekly percentage increase. This would typically involve:
   * Grouping by `WeekStartDate`
   * Calculating the difference in crime counts between consecutive weeks.
   * Dividing the difference by the previous week's count and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage increase.

* **Adjust Time Grouping:**  If you have a different way of defining weeks (e.g., using a start week or a custom time range), adjust the `DATE_TRUNC('week', Crime_Date)` part accordingly.




Let me know if you have further questions or need help with the weekly percentage increase calculation!","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific crime types you're interested in. Could you specify which crime types you want to analyze?","I've created an SQL query to the best of my ability given the information provided. However, there are some assumptions I had to make due to the lack of certain details in the request. For instance, I assumed that ""last reported date"" refers to the most recent date with a crime report for each crime type, and ""last reported area"" refers to the area with the most recent crime report for each crime type. I also assumed that ""percentage increase in this crime type by week"" refers to the percentage change in the total count of a crime type between the most recent week and the week prior.

This SQL query retrieves the count of each crime type for each day of the week in Atlanta. The row is grouped by day of the week (from 1 for Sunday to 7 for Saturday) and crime type, which corresponds to the count of crimes for each day and type. The day of the week is represented as the integer number of the day in the week in the `DAYOFWEEK()` function. The `'Atlanta'` filter in the WHERE clause ensures that only crimes in Atlanta are considered. The result is sorted by both the day of the week and crime type in ascending order.","You can accomplish this by using SQL's conditional aggregate functions, specifically SUM and COUNT, along with CASE statement (or similar) to differentiate between the types, and GROUP BY day_occurred date to get per-day totals. Keep in mind, without a day-column (it might be in a format where days are the first three words) you might have trouble distinguishing between days. Here's what the SQL might look like:

```sql
SELECT
  DAYNAME(Crime_Date) AS Day_Of_Week,
  Crime_Type,
  COUNT(*) AS Number_Of_Crinmes,
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN Day_Occurred IS NULL

  ELSE 0
  END) AS Number_With_Day_Info
FROM atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY Day_Of_Week, Crime_Type;
```

Note: If Day_Occurred is null, it would be counted as 1. Otherwise it would be 0, and would be added to the totals of the conditions. If you don't want to count NULLs in total, just ignore that part.","```sql

```

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT DayOccurred, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount:**  This selects the day of the week, the type of crime, and counts the number of occurrences for each combination.

2. **FROM atlanta_crime_data:** Specifies the table to query.

3. **WHERE DayOfWeek(Crime_Date) BETWEEN 1 AND 7:**  

   - `DayOfWeek(Crime_Date)` extracts the day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.) from the `Crime_Date` column.

   - `BETWEEN 1 AND 7` ensures we only consider data from all days of the week.

4. **GROUP BY DayOccurred, Crime_Type:**  This groups the results by day of the week and crime type, so we get a count for each unique combination.

5. **ORDER BY DayOccurred, Crime_Type:** Sorts the results alphabetically by day of the week and then by crime type for easier readability.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount`**: This selects the hour of the day (`strftime('%H', Crime_Time)` extracts the hour from the `Crime_Time` column), the `Crime_Type`, and counts the number of occurrences for each combination (`COUNT(*)`).

3. **`WHERE Crime_Date LIKE '2020%'`**: Filters the data to include only entries from the year 2020. You can adjust this to include other years if needed.
4. **`GROUP BY 1, 2`**: Groups the results by hour and crime type, so the `COUNT(*)` counts crimes within each hour and type combination.
5. **`ORDER BY 1, 2`**:  Orders the results first by hour and then by crime type for easier readability.

**Important Notes:**

* The `strftime` function is used to extract the hour from the `Crime_Time` column. The specific format may need to be adjusted based on the actual format of your `Crime_Time` data.

This query uses the EXTRACT function to extract the month from the Crime_Date column and then groups the results by this month and the Crime_Type column. The COUNT(*) function is used to count the occurrences of each crime type for each month.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', Crime_Date) AS crime_month, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS crime_count`**:  This selects the following columns:
   - **`crime_month`**: Extracts the year and month from `Crime_Date` using `strftime` and aliases it as `crime_month`.
   - **`Crime_Type`**: Selects the crime type directly.
   - **`crime_count`**: Counts the number of occurrences for each combination of `crime_month` and `Crime_Type`.
2. **`FROM atlanta_crime_data`**: Specifies the table where the data is stored.
3. **`WHERE LIKE '%Atlanta%'`**:  Filters the data to include only records where the city is 'Atlanta'. Adjust this condition based on your table's city column name.
4. **`GROUP BY crime_month, Crime_Type`**:  Groups the results by the extracted `crime_month` and `Crime_Type`, allowing us to count crimes for each combination.
5. **`ORDER BY crime_month, crime_count DESC`**:  Sorts the results first by `crime_month` and then by `crime_count` in descending order (highest count first).



Remember to modify the `WHERE` clause to reflect the actual column name for the city in your `atlanta_crime_data` table.","To fulfill the request, I'll need to know the specific months you're interested in. Could you provide that information?","Here is a SQL query that will give you the count of each crime type for each month in Atlanta:
```
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Crime_Date) AS Month, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM atlanta_crime_data
GROUP BY Month, Crime_Type
ORDER BY Month, Crime_Type;
```
This query first extracts the month from the `Crime_Date` column using the `EXTRACT` function, then groups the data by the extracted month and the `Crime_Type` column. It then counts the number of rows in each group using the `COUNT` function. Finally, it orders the results by the month and the crime type.

Note: This query assumes that the `Crime_Date` column is in a date or datetime format. If it is not, you may need to convert it using the `TO_DATE` or `STR_TO_DATE` function, depending on your database system.

Here is an example of the results you might expect from this query:

| Month | Crime\_Type | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 12 | AUTO THEFT | 1 |

This query selects the day of the week and the crime type from the `nyc_crime_data` table, and counts the number of occurrences for each day/crime type combination. The results are filtered to only include entries from New York (Area_Name = 'New York'). The data is grouped by the day of the week and crime type, and ordered first by the day of the week, then by the crime type.

Note: The `DAYNAME()` function is used to retrieve the weekday from the `Crime_Date` column since the day of the week wasn't directly available in the schema provided.

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour`**: This extracts the hour portion from the `Crime_Time` column using the `strftime` function and assigns it to a new column named `Hour`.
2. **`COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount`**: This counts the number of rows for each unique combination of hour and crime type.
3. **`WHERE Area_Name = 'New York'`**: This filters the results to include only crimes committed in 'New York'. Replace 'New York' with the actual area name if needed.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DAYNAME(Crime_Date) AS DayOfWeek, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount`**: This selects the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column, the `Crime_Type`, and counts the number of occurrences for each combination.
2. **`FROM philly_crime_data`**:  Specifies the table we're querying.
3. **`GROUP BY DayOfWeek, Crime_Type`**: Groups the results by both the day of the week and the crime type, allowing us to count crimes per type per day.
4. **`ORDER BY DayOfWeek, Crime_Type`**: Orders the results alphabetically by day of the week and then by crime type for easier reading.



Let me know if you have any other SQL requests!","To fulfill your request, I'll need to know the specific days of the week you're interested in. Could you provide that information?","Here is a possible SQL query to fulfill the request:
```
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%W') AS Day_Of_Week, 
  Crime_Type, 
  COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM 
  philly_crime_data
GROUP BY 
  Day_Of_Week, 
  Crime_Type;
```
This query uses the `DATE_FORMAT` function to extract the day of the week from the `Crime_Date` column, and then it groups the data by day of the week and crime type. It counts the number of crimes for each combination of day of the week and crime type.

Note that the `%W` format specifier in the `DATE_FORMAT` function returns the day of the week as a full textual representation (e.g. ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", etc.). If you want to use a numerical representation (e.g. 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.), you can use the `%w` format specifier instead.

Here is the result of the query using the provided top entries of the `philly_crime_data` table:
```
+--------------+------------------+-------+
| Day_Of_Week  | Crime_Type       | Count |
+--------------+------------------+-------+
| Tuesday     | Aggravated Assault No Firearm |     1 |

| Tuesday     | Thefts           |     1 |
| Tuesday     | Vandalism/Criminal Mischief |     2 |

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS MassShootingsCount`**: 
   - Extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column using `strftime` and names it as `Month`.
   - Counts the number of rows for each month and names it as `MassShootingsCount`.

2. **`FROM us_shootings`**: 
   - Specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **`WHERE -- Add your criteria for defining a mass shooting here`**: 
   - You **need to add a condition here** to filter for incidents that qualify as mass shootings. This could be based on a specific number of victims killed or injured, or other criteria you want to use.

4. **`GROUP BY Month`**: 
   - Groups the rows by the extracted month, allowing us to count shootings per month.

5. **`ORDER BY Month`**: 
   - Sorts the results in ascending order by month.

**Important:** 

- **Define ""Mass Shooting"":**  The most crucial step is to replace the comment `-- Add your criteria for defining a mass shooting here` with the specific conditions that define a mass shooting in your dataset. This will vary depending on your data and how you want to classify incidents.

- **Data Consistency:** Ensure the `IncidentDate` column is in a consistent format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) for accurate month grouping.


Let me know if you have a specific definition of ""mass shooting"" in mind, and I can help you tailor the query further.","To get the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA, we need to first identify the months from the IncidentDate in the us_shootings table. Then, we can group these incidents by month and count them. Here's the SQL query for that:

    MONTH(IncidentDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS MassShootingsCount
FROM 
    us_shootings
WHERE 
    State = 'USA'
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(IncidentDate)
ORDER BY

```

This query will give us the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA.","To get the count of mass shootings for each month in the USA, we first need to define what qualifies as a ""mass shooting"".

Since the schema indicates that there's a historically consistent format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD), you can use SQL's date functions to extract the month and year. Here's a sample query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM IncidentDate) AS Year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM IncidentDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(SuspectsArrested) AS ArrestedSuspectsCount
FROM us_shootings
WHERE SuspectsArrested > 0
GROUP BY Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

This query does the following:
1. It selects the year and month from the IncidentDate.
2. It counts the number of times `SuspectsArrested` appears greater than 0 for each month and year.
3. It groups the results by year and month.
4. It orders the results by year and month in ascending order.

Note: The `EXTRACT` function is used here to fetch the year and month components from the date. However, depending on the SQL dialect you're using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), the date extraction functions may differ. For example, in SQL Server, you would use `DATEPART(YEAR, IncidentDate)` and `DATEPART(MONTH, IncidentDate)`. Make sure to use the correct function based on the SQL dialect you're working with.","SELECT

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS MonthYear`**: This extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column and formats it as ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2014-01""). This creates a new column named `MonthYear` to group the data by month and year.
2. **`COUNT(CASE WHEN SuspectsArrested > 0 THEN IncidentID END) AS Arrests`**: This counts the number of incidents where `SuspectsArrested` is greater than 0. The `CASE` statement checks if there were any arrests and returns the `IncidentID` only if there were. This avoids counting rows where no arrests occurred.
3. **`GROUP BY MonthYear`**: This groups the results by the `MonthYear` column, so we get a count of arrests for each month and year.
4. **`ORDER BY MonthYear`**: This orders the results chronologically by `MonthYear`.



This query will give you a count of suspects arrested each month over the years, based on the data in the `us_shootings` table.","To get the count of suspects arrested each month over the years, we can use the following SQL query:

Here's how this query works:

1. **`strftime('%Y-%m', IncidentDate) AS Month`**:
   - Extracts the year and month from the `IncidentDate` column and creates a new column called `Month` in the format ""YYYY-MM"".

2. **`COUNT(IncidentID) AS TotalVictimsKilled`**: 
   - Counts the number of unique incident IDs (effectively, the number of shootings) for each month. 

3. **`AVG(VictimsKilled) AS AverageVictimsKilledPerIncident`**:
   - Calculates the average number of victims killed in each shooting incident for each month.

4. **`GROUP BY Month`**: 
   - Groups the results by the extracted `Month` to perform the counting and averaging for each month separately.

5. **`ORDER BY Month`**:
   - Sorts the final results in ascending order by month.","To fulfill the request, we need to group the data by month and calculate the count and average of victims killed. Here's the SQL query for that:

GROUP BY 
  Month
ORDER BY

```
Explanation:

* `DATE_FORMAT(IncidentDate, '%Y-%m')` extracts the year and month from each `IncidentDate` value and formats it as a string in the format 'YYYY-MM'. This produces a value for each row that can be used to group the rows into separate months.
* `SUM(VictimsKilled)` adds up the values in the `VictimsKilled` column for each group of rows corresponding to a particular month.
* `AVG(VictimsKilled)` calculates the average value in the `VictimsKilled` column for each group of rows corresponding to a particular month.
* The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows into separate months based on the value of `Month`.
* The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the value of `Month` in ascending order.

This query assumes that the data type of the `IncidentDate` column is `DATETIME` or `DATE`. If it is a different data type, you may need to use a different function to extract the month from each value.

```sql

)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    yearly_change_in_GRAPI

```

This query does the following:

1. The `yearly_average_GRAPI` CTE (Common Table Expression) calculates the average GRAPI (Gross Rent as Percent of Household Income) for each year using the min and max values for that year (given as `income_percent_min` and `income_percent_max`, respectively) in our `housing_gross_rent_percent` table.

2. The `yearly_change_in_GRAPI` CTE calculates the year-on-year change in GRAPI by subtracting the `prev.average_GRAPI` from the `curr.average_GRAPI` for each year.

3. The final `SELECT` statement retrieves all entries from the `yearly_change_in_GRAPI` CTE, ordered by year in ascending order.

Note: The query uses a LEFT JOIN because there might be years in the `housing_gross_rent_percent` table without a previous year to compare. The LEFT JOIN will ensure that all years are included in the output, with a NULL `change_in_GRAPI` value for the first year(s) appearing in the table.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **YearlyGRAPI CTE:** This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the average `income_percent_max` (representing GRAPI) for each year.
2. **Main Query:**
   - It joins the `YearlyGRAPI` CTE with itself (aliased as `y1` and `y2`) to compare consecutive years.
   - It selects the year, the average GRAPI for both years, and calculates the year-on-year percentage change using the formula: `((y2.average_grapi - y1.average_grapi) / y1.average_grapi) * 100`.
   - It orders the results by year.

**Notes:**

- This query assumes you want to calculate the change year-on-year (e.g., 2015 to 2016, 2016 to 2017, etc.).
- The `AVG(income_percent_max)` calculation provides a representative GRAPI value for each year.","To get the year-on-year change in GRAPI, we need to calculate the difference in GRAPI values between two consecutive years.

However, since there is only one year in the provided table (2015), we cannot compute the year-on-year change as there's no previous year data. But assuming that we have the same table for multiple years (e.g., 2014, 2015, 2016), here is an SQL query that calculates the year-on-year change of SMOCAPI:

```sql
WITH Average_SMOCAPI AS (
  SELECT
    year,
    AVG((income_percent_max + income_percent_min) / 2) as avg_SMOCAPI
  FROM
    household_income_percent_with_mortgage
  GROUP BY
    year
)

SELECT
  a.year,
  a.avg_SMOCAPI,
  (a.avg_SMOCAPI - b.avg_SMOCAPI) as year_on_year_change
FROM
  Average_SMOCAPI a
LEFT JOIN
  Average_SMOCAPI b
ON
  a.year > b.year
ORDER BY
  a.year;
```

This query calculates the average SMOCAPI for each year in the Average_SMOCAPI CTE (Common Table Expression). Then, it performs a self-join on the CTE to compare the values from different years. The year-on-year change is calculated as the difference between the current year's average SMOCAPI and the previous year's average SMOCAPI. 

Please note that this query calculates the year-on-year change between all possible pairs of years, and the result might contain duplicate rows if the data includes multiple observations from the same year. If you need the year-on-year change only between consecutive years (e.g., 2015 -> 2016, but not 2015 -> 2014), you may need to adjust the JOIN condition to make sure the years are consecutive, like:

```sql
SELECT
  a.year,
  a.avg_SMOCAPI,
  (a.avg_SMOCAPI - LAG(a.avg_SMOCAPI) OVER (ORDER BY a.year)) as year_on_year_change
FROM
  Average_SMOCAPI a
ORDER BY
  a.year;
```

This approach uses window function LAG to calculate the change compared to the previous year.","You can use the following SQL query to get year-on-year change in SMOCAPI:

```sql
SELECT
    S1.year AS year_1,
    S1.income_percent_avg AS SMOCAPI_1,
    S2.year AS year_2,
    S2.income_percent_avg AS SMOCAPI_2,
    (S2.income_percent_avg - S1.income_percent_avg) AS year_on_year_change
FROM (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(income_percent_max) AS income_percent_avg
    FROM
        household_income_percent_with_mortgage
    WHERE
        income_percent_min = 0 AND income_percent_max = 100
    GROUP BY
        year
) S1
JOIN (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(income_percent_max) AS income_percent_avg
    FROM

    WHERE
        income_percent_min = 0 AND income_percent_max = 100
    GROUP BY
        year
) S2 ON S1.year = S2.year - 1
ORDER BY
    year_1;
```

This query calculates SMOCAPI and its year-on-year change. It first finds the average income_percent_max for a given year where income_percent_min is 0 and income_percent_max is 100 (SMOCAPI) for each year using subqueries S1 and S2. Then, it joins the results of both subqueries on year. Finally, it calculates the year-on-year change in SMOCAPI for each year using the income_percent_avg values from S1 and S2.","```sql

```

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression):**
   - We create a CTE called `MonthlySMOCAPI` to calculate the average `income_percent_max` (representing SMOCAPI) for each year.

2. **Main Query:**
   - We use two instances of the `MonthlySMOCAPI` CTE: `m1` and `m2`. 
   - `m1` represents the current year's data.
   - `m2` represents the previous year's data. We join them on `year` using a condition `m1.year = m2.year + 1`.
   - We select the current year, the SMOCAPI for the current year, the SMOCAPI for the previous year, and the year-on-year change calculated as: `((current_year_smocapi - previous_year_smocapi) / previous_year_smocapi) * 100`.


**Note:** 
- Replace `year` and `income_percent_max` with your actual column names if they differ.
- This query assumes you want to calculate the year-on-year change for each year, starting from the second year in your data.","To get the year-on-year change in SMOCAPI, we need to first calculate the SMOCAPI for each year and then find the difference.

* **SELECT zipcode:** This selects the `zipcode` column from the table.
* **FROM household_income_percent_without_mortgage:** This specifies the table to query.
* **WHERE year = 2017:** This filters the data to only include entries for the year 2017.

* **AND income_percent_max > 28:** This filters for entries where the `income_percent_max` value is greater than 28.

**Note:**

* The `LIKE 'GA%'` filter assumes a standard pattern for Georgia zip codes. You may need to modify it if your data uses a different format.

   - Selects the `fuel_source` column and calculates the sum of `total_heating_units` for each fuel type using `CASE` statements.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - Specifies the table `housing_heating_fuel`.

3. **WHERE Clause:**
   - Filters the data to include only records from the year 2022.

4. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - Groups the results by `fuel_source`, allowing the aggregate functions to calculate totals for each fuel type.

5. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   - Sorts the results alphabetically by `fuel_source`.

Note: I am not able to determine the exact SQL query to use to filter the `zipcode` values that belong to Georgia, as I do not have information about the structure or content of any other tables or columns in your database that relate to geographical information. You may need to consult your database's documentation or seek additional assistance in order to determine the correct method for filtering the `zipcode` values in this way.

Additionally, I made the assumption that the `income_percent_max` column represents the upper bound of the home-ownership costs as a percentage of household income for each row. If this interpretation is incorrect, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Here is an example of how you could filter the `zipcode` values using a `JOIN` clause with a table that contains geographical information, if one is available:

Please note that the SQL query might slightly differ based on the SQL dialect you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), and SQL Server does not have a built-in median function. However, we can use PERCENTILE_CONT in SQL Server (or the equivalent in other SQL dialects) to calculate the median.

Here's an example query using SQL Server syntax:

```sql
WITH ZipcodeHousingValue AS (
  SELECT
    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode) AS MedianMinPrice
  FROM housing_value
)

SELECT DISTINCT
  zipcode,
  MedianMinPrice
FROM ZipcodeHousingValue;
```

In the example query above, we're using a common table expression (CTE) called ZipcodeHousingValue to calculate the median house_value_min for each zipcode using the PERCENTILE_CONT function in a window-based approach. We're partitioning the data by zipcode and ordering the house_value_min values within each group to calculate the median.

The outer SELECT statement consists of the distinct zipcodes and their respective MedianMinPrice, which can be considered an estimate of the median housing value by zipcode.

Remember that SQL dialects may vary, so please adapt the query to fit your environment. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
WITH ZipcodeHousingValue AS (
  SELECT
    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS MedianMinPrice
  FROM housing_value
  GROUP BY zipcode
)

SELECT
  zipcode,
  MedianMinPrice
FROM ZipcodeHousingValue;
```

This query calculates the median housing value directly per the SQL dialect and the available functions. However, the concept of estimation remains the same.","SELECT h.zipcode, AVG((h.house_value_min + h.house_value_max)/2) as median_house_value
FROM housing_value h
GROUP BY h.zipcode","```sql
SELECT h.zipcode, ROUND(AVG(h.house_value_min)) AS median_house_value
FROM housing_value h
GROUP BY h.zipcode
ORDER BY h.zipcode;
```","```sql

    zipcode,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value
FROM
    housing_value
GROUP BY
    zipcode;
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value:** This selects the `zipcode` and calculates the median `house_value_min` for each zipcode. The `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` function returns the 50th percentile, which is the median.
* **FROM housing_value:** This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **GROUP BY zipcode:** This groups the rows by `zipcode`, allowing the median calculation to be performed for each unique zipcode.


This query will give you the median housing value for each distinct zipcode in the `housing_value` table.","To get the median housing value by zipcode, we need to first aggregate the house values by zipcode and then find the median. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_min) AS median_house_value
FROM housing_value
GROUP BY zipcode;
```

This query groups the data by zipcode and uses the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function to calculate the median house value.","To find the median housing value by zipcode, we first need to write a subquery to get the median house value for each zipcode. We can use the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function to calculate the median. Then, we can use this subquery to join back to the original housing\_value table to get the zipcode. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
WITH median_house_value AS (
  SELECT zipcode, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY house_value_max) AS median_house_value
  FROM housing_value
  GROUP BY zipcode
)

FROM median_house_value m
JOIN housing_value hv ON m.zipcode = hv.zipcode
WHERE hv.house_value_max = m.median_house_value;
```

This query calculates the median of the `house_value_max` column for each zipcode, and then returns the zipcode and the median housing value. Note that we use `house_value_max` instead of `house_value_min` because the median is calculated based on the sorted values, and the provided data has a range for the housing value. Therefore, we assume that `house_value_max` will give us the actual median housing value.

FROM housing_year_built
WHERE year_built_min >= 2020
GROUP BY zipcode
ORDER BY houses_built_in_or_after_2020 DESC;
```

Explanation:

- The `SELECT` statement chooses the columns to be displayed. In this case, we want to display the `zipcode` and the count of houses built in or after 2020, which we'll alias as `houses_built_in_or_after_2020`.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the table that we want to query, which is `housing_year_built`.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies a condition to filter the rows. In this case, we only want the rows where `year_built_min` is greater than or equal to 2020.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by `zipcode`, so we can calculate the count of houses for each zipcode.
- The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows in each group, effectively giving us the count of houses for each zipcode.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result by the count of houses in a descending order, so the top entries (zipcodes with the most houses) will be at the top.

Note: This query assumes that `year_built_min` refers to the range of years when the house was built (i.e., the house was built in `year_built_min`'s year). If `year_built_min` refers to the earliest year in the date range instead, replace `year_built_min` with `year_built_max` in the `WHERE` clause and the query will work as expected.","SELECT zipcode, COUNT(id)

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT zipcode, COUNT(*) AS houses_built_after_2020**: This selects the ""zipcode"" column and counts the number of rows for each zipcode, aliasing the count as ""houses_built_after_2020"".
2. **FROM housing_year_built**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
3. **WHERE year_built_min >= 2020**: This filters the data to include only houses built in or after 2020. We use `year_built_min` because it represents the earliest year a house was built within that data entry.
4. **GROUP BY zipcode**: This groups the results by zipcode, allowing us to count houses built after 2020 for each unique zipcode.

This query calculates the percentage of distinct zipcodes having GRAPI greater than 28% in the year 2022. It uses the `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode)` aggregation function to count unique zipcodes that met the criteria, and divides this count by the total number of distinct zipcodes in 2022, then multiplies it by 100 to get the percentage.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS percentage`**:
   -  This selects the calculated percentage and names it `percentage`.
   -  `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode)` counts the number of unique zipcodes.
   -  `CAST(... AS REAL)` converts the count to a real number for accurate percentage calculation.
   -  Multiplying by 100 gives the percentage. 

2. **`FROM housing_gross_rent_percent`**:
   -  Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.

3. **`WHERE year = 2022 AND GRAPI > 28`**:
   -  Filters the data to include only records from the year 2022 and where the `GRAPI` (gross rent as a percentage of income) is greater than 28%.

This query works by:

1. Selecting the count of unique zipcodes including their households having `SMOCAPI` greater than 30% (income_percent_min > 30) in the year 2022.
2. Calculating the percentage by dividing the count in step 1 by the total number of records in the year 2022 (subquery in the SELECT clause), and multiplying it by 100.0 to get the result in percentage.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode_id)`**: This calculates the percentage.
   - `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode)` counts the number of unique zipcodes that meet the criteria.
   -  `COUNT(DISTINCT zipcode_id)` counts the total number of unique zipcodes in the table for the year 2022.
   - `CAST(... AS REAL)` converts the count to a real number for accurate percentage calculation.
   - Multiplication by 100 converts the result to a percentage.

2. **`FROM household_income_percent_with_mortgage`**: Specifies the table to query.

3. **`WHERE year = 2022 AND income_percent_max > 30`**: Filters the data to include only records from 2022 where the maximum income percentage (`income_percent_max`) is greater than 30%.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns to be retrieved:
    - `zipcode`: The zip code for each area.
    - `male_ratio`:  Calculates the percentage of males within each zip code.
    - `female_ratio`: Calculates the percentage of females within each zip code.

2. **FROM**: This clause indicates the table from which the data is fetched: `demographic_basics`.

3. **WHERE**: This clause filters the results based on the specified conditions:
    - `year = 2022`: Retrieves data for the year 2022.
    - `zipcode LIKE '30%'`: Filters for zip codes in Georgia, assuming they start with '30'.

4. **Calculations**:
    - The expressions `(total_population_male / total_population) * 100` and `(total_population_female / total_population) * 100` calculate the male and female ratios as percentages.

*   **CASE Statement:** Used to map numeric race IDs to more readable names.
*   **Aggregate Function:** `AVG()` calculates the average count for each race.
*   **GROUP BY:** Organizes the data for averaging.
*   **Filtering:** Ensures only years after 2016 are included.

**Explanation:**

* **SELECT zipcode, (hispanic_or_latino_total * 100.0 / race_total_populatio) AS hispanic_percentage**: This selects two columns:
    * `zipcode`:  The zip code for each record.
    * `hispanic_percentage`:  This calculated column represents the percentage of Hispanics/Latinos in each zip code. It's calculated by dividing the `hispanic_or_latino_total` by the `race_total_populatio` and multiplying by 100.
* **FROM demographic_race**: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **WHERE year = 2022**: Filters the results to include only data for the year 2022.
* **GROUP BY zipcode**: Groups the results by zip code, allowing us to calculate the percentage for each zip code separately.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT:**

   - `percent_change`: Calculates the percentage difference in car-alone commuters between 2019 and 2022.
2. **((SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN car_alone ELSE 0 END) / SUM(total_workers) * 100) - ... ):**  
   - This part calculates the percentage of car-alone commuters for each year:
     - `CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN car_alone ELSE 0 END`: If the year is 2022, take the `car_alone` value, otherwise, take 0.
     - `SUM(...)`: Sums up the `car_alone` values for each year.
     - `SUM(total_workers)`: Gets the total number of workers in each zipcode.
     - `/`: Divides the summed `car_alone` by the total workers to get the percentage.
     - `* 100`: Multiplies by 100 to convert the percentage to a whole number.
   - The final calculation subtracts the percentage from 2019 from the percentage in 2022 to get the percentage change.
3. **FROM economic_commute_to_work:** Specifies the table to query.
4. **WHERE year IN (2019, 2022) AND zipcode LIKE '30%':**  
   - Filters the data to include only years 2019 and 2022.
   - Filters for zipcodes that start with '30' assuming these are Atlanta zipcodes.
5. **GROUP BY zipcode:** Groups the results by each unique zipcode to calculate the percentage change for each zipcode.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT clause:** 
   - `zipcode`: Selects the zip code for each row.
   - `AVG(mean_travel_time) AS mean_commute_time_2017`: Calculates the average commute time for the year 2017 and aliases it as ""mean_commute_time_2017"".
   - `(AVG(mean_travel_time) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode ORDER BY year ASC)) AS running_mean_commute_time`: Calculates the cumulative average commute time for each zip code, ordered by year, using the `AVG` function with a `OVER` clause. This will give us the average commute time up to each year.
2. **FROM clause:**
   - Specifies the table `economic_commute_to_work` from where to retrieve the data.
3. **WHERE clause:**
   - Filters the data to include only rows where the `year` is either 2017 or 2022.
4. **GROUP BY clause:**
   - Groups the results by `zipcode` so we get aggregate statistics (average commute time) for each zip code.
5. **ORDER BY clause:**
   - Sorts the results by `zipcode` for easier readability.


This query will provide you with the mean commute time for each zip code in Georgia for both 2017 and 2022.  You can then calculate the difference between these two values to find the change in mean commute time.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the specific columns you're interested in for the change in mean commute time.

This query uses the `LIKE` operator to select only zipcodes that start with ""30"", which are in Georgia. It then calculates the average mean travel time for 2017 and 2022 separately, and subtracts the 2017 average from the 2022 average to get the change in mean commute time.

Note that this query assumes that there are no missing values for the `mean_travel_time` column. If there are missing values, you might want to consider excluding those rows from the calculation using the `WHERE` clause.

Another assumption made by this query is that the `year` column is of type `integer` or `smallint`. If it is of a different data type, the `WHERE` clause and the `FILTER` clauses might need to be adjusted accordingly.",-1,2.9572019280000177,0.39999999999999997,0.14733542319749215,"```sql

Let me know if you need help adjusting this query for a specific subset of data or need further clarification on any part of it.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the specific zipcodes in Atlanta you're interested in. Could you provide those?","To get the change in percentage of those working from home between year 2019 and 2022 for each zipcode in Atlanta, you can use the following SQL query:

This query does the following:

1. **Filters the data**: It starts by selecting only the data for the year 2022 using the `WHERE` clause.
2. **Calculates percentages**: For each commute type, it calculates the percentage by:
   - Summing the `total_workers` for that commute type 
   - Dividing the sum by the total sum of `total_workers` for the year
   - Multiplying by 100 to get the percentage
3. **Groups the results**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `commute_type`, so you get one row for each commute type with its corresponding percentage.

**Please note:** This query assumes your `commute_to_work` table has a column named `commute_type`. If your column name is different, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.

In this query, we select three columns: `year`, `median_household_income`, and `mean_household_income` from the table `economic_income_and_benefits`, grouped by `year`, `median_household_income`, and `mean_household_income`. Finally, the result is ordered by `year` in ascending order. Please note that this will group the data by each unique combination of `year`, `median_household_income`, and `mean_household_income`.

**Explanation:**

* **`SELECT year`**: This selects the year column.
* **`AVG(mean_household_income) AS mean_income`**: This calculates the average of the `mean_household_income` column for each year and aliases it as `mean_income`.
* **`PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY median_household_income) AS median_income`**: This calculates the median `median_household_income` for each year. `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` represents the 50th percentile, which is the median. 
* **`FROM economic_income_and_benefits`**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **`GROUP BY year`**: This groups the data by year, allowing us to calculate aggregate values for each year.

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
   * We use two CTEs: `Income2017` and `Income2022`.
   * Each CTE calculates the average median household income for a given year (2017 or 2022) grouped by `zipcode`.

2. **JOIN:**
   * We join the two CTEs on the `zipcode` column to ensure we are comparing the average income for the same zipcodes across the years.

3. **Calculation:**
   *  We subtract the average median income from 2017 (`i2017.avg_median_income_2017`) from the average median income from 2022 (`i2022.avg_median_income_2022`) to get the `change_avg_median_income`.



Let me know if you have any other SQL query requests!","To generate the SQL query, I need to know the specific years you're interested in for the median household income. You mentioned 2017 and 2022. Is that correct?","Here is a possible SQL query that should fulfill your request:

This query first filters the table to only include rows from the years 2017 and 2022. Then, for each zipcode, it calculates the average median household income for those two years. Finally, it subtracts the average for 2017 from the average for 2022 to get the change in income.

Note that this query uses the `FILTER` clause, which is available in PostgreSQL and some other database systems. If you are using a different database system that does not support `FILTER`, you can achieve the same result using a subquery instead.

Also note that this query assumes that the `median_household_income` column contains the median household income, not the mean. If it contains the mean, you should use `mean_household_income` instead in the query.",-1,2.993386024000074,0.6271186440677966,0.20108695652173914,"```sql

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT zipcode, AVG(median_household_income) AS median_income, AVG(mean_household_income) AS mean_income:** This selects the `zipcode` column and calculates the average of `median_household_income` and `mean_household_income` for each zipcode. The results are aliased as `median_income` and `mean_income` for clarity.
2. **FROM economic_income_and_benefits:** This specifies the table from which the data is retrieved.
3. **GROUP BY zipcode:** This groups the rows based on the `zipcode` column, allowing the aggregate functions (`AVG`) to calculate the average for each unique zipcode.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the specific years you're interested in. Could you provide that information?","Here is the SQL query to get the median and mean household income for each zipcode of Georgia:
```
SELECT zipcode,

       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY median_household_income) AS median_household_income
FROM economic_income_and_benefits
WHERE zipcode LIKE '30%'
GROUP BY zipcode;
```
The `WHERE` clause filters the data to only include zipcodes from Georgia (assuming the first digit of Georgia zipcodes is 3). The `PERCENTILE_CONT` function is used to calculate the median household income. Note that this function is available in some databases, but not all. If it is not available in your database, you may need to use a different approach to calculate the median.

Also, please note that in some databases, the syntax for the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function may be slightly different. For example, in MySQL, you can use the `PERCENTILE` function instead.

Here is an example of how you can calculate the median using the `PERCENTILE` function in MySQL:
```
SELECT zipcode,
       AVG(mean_household_income) AS average_household_income,

* **`SELECT zipcode, ...`**: This selects the `zipcode` column and calculates the desired counts.
* **`SUM(CASE WHEN not_a_us_citizen = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS non_us_citizen_count`**: This calculates the total count of non-US citizens by using a `CASE` statement. If `not_a_us_citizen` is 1 (indicating non-US citizen), it adds 1 to the sum; otherwise, it adds 0.
* **`SUM(foreign_born_population) AS foreign_born_population_count`**: This calculates the total foreign-born population by summing the `foreign_born_population` column.
* **`FROM social_citizenship_status`**: This specifies the table to retrieve data from.
* **`WHERE state = 'GA'`**: This filters the data to only include entries for Georgia.
* **`GROUP BY zipcode`**: This groups the rows by `zipcode` so the counts are calculated for each zipcode separately.



Let me know if you have any other requests or if you need modifications to this query!","To fulfill the request, I'll need to join the `social_citizenship_status` table with a table that contains the zipcodes and their corresponding locations to filter only Georgia's zipcodes. Unfortunately, I can't directly join tables in this conversation. However, I can guide you on how to structure the query. You would need to use a JOIN with a condition to filter by Georgia's zipcodes. Then, you can use the `foreign_born_population` and `not_a_us_citizen` columns to get the counts you're looking for.","Here is a possible SQL query to fulfill the request:
```
SELECT zipcode, SUM(foreign_born_population) AS total_foreign_born, SUM(not_a_us_citizen) AS total_non_us_citizen
FROM social_citizenship_status
WHERE zipcode REGEXP '^ZCTA5 [0-9]{5}$' AND state = 'Georgia'
GROUP BY zipcode;
```
This query first filters the rows of the `social_citizenship_status` table to only include those with a zipcode that starts with 'ZCTA5' followed by five digits, and those with a state value of 'Georgia'. It then groups the remaining rows by zipcode and calculates the sum of the `foreign_born_population` and `not_a_us_citizen` columns for each group, giving the total foreign-born population and non-US citizen count for each zipcode.

Note that the `REGEXP` operator is used to match the regular expression pattern for the zipcode values. This operator is specific to certain SQL databases, such as MySQL. If you are using a different database, you may need to use a different method to match the zipcode pattern.

Also note that the query does not filter the rows based on the year column. If you want to include only rows with a specific year or range of years, you can add a condition to the `WHERE` clause to specify that. For example, to include only rows with a year value of 2015, you can add the condition `year = 2015` to the `WHERE` clause.

3. **SELECT:** The main query selects all the calculated percentages and groups them by `year`.

4. **ORDER BY:** The results are ordered by `year` for easy readability.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT:** This clause specifies the columns we want to retrieve:
   - `year`: The year of the data.
   - `zipcode`: The postal code.
   - `computer_percentage`: Calculated as `(with_a_computer / total_households) * 100`, representing the percentage of households with a computer in each zipcode for each year.
   - `broadband_percentage`: Calculated similarly for broadband subscription.

2. **FROM:** This clause indicates the table we are querying, which is `social_computer_internet_usage`.

3. **WHERE:** This clause filters the data to include only years after 2016.

4. **GROUP BY:** This clause groups the results by `year` and `zipcode`, allowing us to calculate percentages for each unique combination.

5. **ORDER BY:** This clause sorts the results by `year` and then by `zipcode` for easier readability.



This query will provide you with a table containing the year, zip code, percentage of households with computers, and percentage of households with broadband subscriptions for each zip code in years after 2016.","To fulfill the request, I will need to calculate the percentage of households with a computer and broadband subscription for each zipcode starting from 2016. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    zipcode,
    YEAR,
    ROUND((with_a_computer / total_households) * 100, 2) AS computer_percentage,
    ROUND((with_broadband_internet_subscription / total_households) * 100, 2) AS broadband_percentage
FROM 
    social_computer_internet_usage
WHERE 
    YEAR > 2015
ORDER BY 
    zipcode;
```

This query will first filter out the data for years after 2015, then calculate the percentage of households with a computer and broadband subscription for each zipcode, rounding the results to two decimal places. Finally, it will sort the results by zipcode.","Here is the SQL query to fulfill the request:

```sql
SELECT 
    zipcode,
    (SUM(with_a_computer) * 100.0 / SUM(total_households)) AS percentage_with_computer,

FROM
    social_computer_internet_usage
WHERE
    year > 2016
GROUP BY
    zipcode
ORDER BY
    zipcode;
```

This query will return the percentage of households with a computer and the percentage of households with a broadband subscription for each zipcode, for all years after 2016. It calculates the required percentages by dividing the sum of the `with_a_computer` and `with_broadband_internet_subscription` columns by the sum of the `total_households` column for each zipcode, and then multiplying by 100.0 to get the percentage.",-1,1.5098498989998461,0.6933333333333334,0.1926782273603083,"```sql

This SQL query fulfills the request by breaking down the problem into manageable subqueries. It first summarizes the total number of crimes and the most recent crime date for each area and crime type. Then the most common crime type is calculated. The weekly increase in crimes by percentage is calculated using the count of crimes within the past 7 days and comparing it to the total number of crimes in the preceding week. Finally, these subqueries are joined together and aggregated using the `GROUP BY` clause to get the final output for each area of Atlanta.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **`CrimeTotals` CTE:**
   - Calculates the total crime count, `Last_Reported_Date`, and groups by `Area_Name` and `Crime_Type`.
   - We also use `ROW_NUMBER()` to find the row with the most frequent crime type for each area. This is used later to get the most common crime type.

2. **`MostCommonCrime` CTE:**
   - Selects the `Area_Name` and the `Crime_Type` for each area for the most common crime based on `rn = 1` from the `CrimeTotals` CTE.

3. **Main Query:**
   - Joins the `CrimeTotals` CTE with the `MostCommonCrime` CTE based on `Area_Name`.
   - Uses `LAG()` function to calculate the weekly increase in crime counts by comparing the current week's count to the previous week's count. The percentage increase is then calculated.

**Important Notes:**

- This query assumes your date format is consistent.  You may need to adjust it if the date format in your data is different.
- `LAG()` function requires an `ORDER BY` clause in the subquery. Here, we assume you want to order by `Area_Name` for week-over-week comparisons. You can change this order based on your requirements.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific areas of Atlanta you're interested in. Could you provide me with the names of these areas?","Here is a possible SQL query to fulfill your request. Note that calculating the ""weekly increase in crimes by percentage"" is a bit complex, as it requires comparing the number of crimes for the current week to the number of crimes for the previous week. This query assumes that the ""Day_Occurred"" column contains the day of the week (e.g. ""Monday"") that the crime was reported.

To get the weekly increase in crimes by percentage, we need to calculate the number of crimes for the current week and the number of crimes for the previous week. We can do this by using the WEEK() function in MySQL, which returns the week number for a given date. We can then use a conditional sum to count the number of crimes for the current week and the previous week.

Here is the query:

```
SELECT 
  Area\_Name, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total\_Crime\_Count, 
  MAX(Crime\_Date) AS Last\_Reported\_Date, 
  Crime\_Type AS Most\_Common\_Crime\_Type,
  (CURRENT\_WEEK() - 1) AS Current\_Week\_Number,
  (SUM(CASE WHEN WEEK(Crime\_Date) = (CURRENT\_WEEK() - 2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS Previous\_Week\_Crime\_Count,
  (100.0 \* (COUNT(*) - SUM(CASE WHEN WEEK(Crime\_Date) = (CURRENT\_WEEK() - 2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) / SUM(CASE WHEN WEEK(Crime\_Date) = (CURRENT\_WEEK() - 2) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS Weekly\_Crime\_Increase\_Percentage
FROM 
  atlanta\_crime\_data
GROUP BY 
  Area\_Name, Crime\_Type
ORDER BY 
  Area\_Name, Total\_Crime\_Count DESC;
```

This query will return a table with the following columns:

* Area\_Name: the name of the area in Atlanta
* Total\_Crime\_Count: the total number of crimes in the area
* Last\_Reported\_Date: the date of the most recent crime in the area
* Most\_Common\_Crime\_Type: the type of crime that occurred most frequently in the area
* Current\_Week\_Number: the week number for the current week (e.g. 1 for the first week of the year)
* Previous\_Week\_Crime\_Count: the number of crimes that occurred in the previous week
* Weekly\_Crime\_Increase\_Percentage: the percentage increase in crimes from the previous week to the current week

Note that this query assumes that you are using MySQL as your database management system. If you are using a different system, the syntax for some of the functions (e.g. WEEK(), CURRENT\_WEEK()) may be different.

```

This query does the following:

1. The `Crime_Counts` CTE (Common Table Expression) generates the total count of different types of crimes in different areas, the last reported date of any crime, and the weekly increase in crimes by percentage.
2. The `Most_Common_Crime` CTE finds the most common type of crime in each area.
3. The `Total_Crime_Counts` CTE calculates the total crime count in each area and the last reported date.
4. Finally, the outer query joins all three CTEs to provide the final result: the area name, total crime count, last reported date of any crime, the most common type of crime, and the weekly increase in crimes by percentage.

Please note that the calculation of weekly increase in crimes by percentage is calculated as a percentage of the overall crimes reported in the year 2020 and may not be accurate due to the limited dataset. Depending on the actual requirement, this calculation can be modified or removed.","```SQL

**Explanation:**

1. **`CrimeSummary` CTE:** 
   - Calculates the total crime count for each `Area_Name` and `Crime_Type`.
   - Uses `MAX(Date_Reported)` to find the last reported date for each area/crime type combination.
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank crimes by count within each area, allowing us to identify the most common crime type later.

2. **`CommonCrimes` CTE:**
   - Selects the `Area_Name` and `Crime_Type` where the `rn` (rank) is 1, representing the most common crime for each area.

3. **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
   - Joins the `CrimeSummary` and `CommonCrimes` CTEs to retrieve the desired information.
   - Fills in the `Most_Common_Crime_Type` column from the `CommonCrimes` CTE.
   - **Notes on Weekly Increase:**
     - The code includes a commented-out placeholder for calculating the weekly increase in crime percentage. 
     - Implementing this functionality accurately would require additional logic to group crimes by week and perform the calculations. 

**Remember:**

- You might need to adjust the date formatting or calculations depending on the specifics of your `Date_Reported` column.
- The example's weekly increase calculation is a placeholder. You'll need to refine it based on your data and requirements.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the specific areas of LA you're interested in. Could you provide me with the list of areas?","Here is a SQL query that fulfills your request:
```
SELECT 
  Area_Name, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crime_Count,
  MAX(Date_Reported) AS Last_Reported_Date,
  Crime_Type AS Most_Common_Crime_Type,
  (SUM(CASE WHEN WEEK(Date_Reported) = WEEK(CURRENT_DATE()) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 AS Weekly_Increase
FROM 
  la_crime_data
GROUP BY 
  Area_Name, Crime_Type
ORDER BY 
  Area_Name, Total_Crime_Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This query calculates the total crime count, last reported date of any crime, and most common crime type for each area of LA. It also calculates the weekly increase in crimes by percentage, but this calculation is based on the assumption that the current date is being used. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Note that the `WEEK()` function is used to group crimes by week. This function may not be available in all SQL implementations. In such cases, you may need to use a different method to group crimes by week.

Additionally, the `CURRENT_DATE()` function is used to get the current date. This function may also not be available in all SQL implementations. If this is the case, you may need to use a different method to get the current date.

Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the area with the most crimes. If you want to return all areas, you can remove this clause.

This SQL query does the following:

1. Creates a subquery named `crime_data` that calculates the total crime count, the last reported date, and ranks the crime types per area based on their count using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function. It also calculates the previous week's crime count if available.

2. Creates another subquery named `ranked_crime_data` that retrieves the most common crime type per area using the results from `crime_data`.

3. Creates another subquery `crime_increase` that calculates the weekly crime increase percentage by comparing the current week's crime count to the previous week's crime count.

4. Finally, selects the Area Name, Crime Type, Crime Count, Last Reported Date, Most Common Crime, and Weekly Crime Increase Percentage from `ranked_crime_data` joined with `crime_increase` on Area_Name and Crime_Type.

This query gives you the total crime count, last reported date of any crime, and the type of crime, most common crime type, and weekly increase in crimes by percentage for each area in New York.

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query uses two CTEs:
   - `crime_counts`:
     - Calculates the total crime count for each area and the latest crime date.
     - Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Area_Name ORDER BY Crime_ID)` to keep track of the order of crimes within each area. This will be helpful for calculating weekly percentage increases.
   - `most_common_crimes`:
     - Determines the most common crime type for each area based on count.
2. **Main Query:**
   - Selects the area name, total crime count, last reported date, most common crime type.
   - Calculates the weekly percentage increase in crime using:
     - `LAG(cc.Total_Crime_Count, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY cc.Area_Name ORDER BY cc.Last_Reported_Date)` to get the previous week's crime count for each area.
     - The percentage increase formula: `((current_count - previous_count) * 100.0) / previous_count`.
   - `JOIN`s the `crime_counts` and `most_common_crimes` CTEs to link the data.
   - Orders the results by area name for clarity.

**Note:**

- This query assumes that the `Crime_Date` column represents weekdays and allows for comparing consecutive weeks. If your data structure is different (e.g., includes dates for every day), you'll need to modify the query to handle week boundaries appropriately.","To generate the SQL query for this request, I'll need to break it down into smaller parts. First, let's start with the total crime count and the last reported date of any crime for each area.","To fulfill the request, the following SQL query can be used:
```
SELECT 
  Area_Name, 
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Crime_Count,
  MAX(Crime_Date) AS Last_Reported_Date,
  (SELECT Crime_Type FROM nyc_crime_data c2 WHERE c2.Area_Name = c1.Area_Name GROUP BY Crime_Type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1) AS Most_Common_Crime_Type,
  ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nyc_crime_data c2 WHERE c2.Area_Name = c1.Area_Name AND c2.Crime_Date >= DATE_SUB(MAX(c1.Crime_Date), INTERVAL 7 DAY) GROUP BY WEEK(c2.Crime_Date)) - COUNT(*))/COUNT(*)*100 AS Weekly_Increase_Percentage
FROM nyc_crime_data c1
GROUP BY Area_Name;
```
This query calculates the total crime count, last reported date of any crime, most common crime type, and weekly increase in crimes by percentage for each area of New York.

The total crime count is calculated using the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function, grouped by `Area_Name`.

The last reported date of any crime is calculated by finding the maximum `Crime_Date` for each area, using the `MAX` aggregate function, grouped by `Area_Name`.

The most common crime type is calculated by finding the crime type with the highest count for each area, using a subquery with the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function, grouped by `Crime_Type`, and then ordering by `COUNT(*)` in descending order. The `LIMIT` clause is used to select only the top result.

The weekly increase in crimes by percentage is calculated by finding the number of crimes in the past 7 days for each area, using a subquery with the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function, grouped by `WEEK(Crime_Date)`, and then finding the difference between this value and the total count for each area. This value is then divided by the total count and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage change.

Note that the `DATE_SUB` function is used to calculate the date 7 days prior to the max `Crime_Date` for each area, and the `WEEK` function is used to group the crimes by week. These functions may not be available in all SQL databases, so you may need to use a different method to calculate the weekly increase in crimes.

Additionally, the latitude and longitude columns are not used in this query, as the request does not ask for this information. If you need to include the latitude and longitude in the results, you can include them in the `SELECT` clause, for example: `SELECT Area_Name, Latitude, Longitude, ...`

This query first calculates the total crime count, last reported date of any crime, and the most common crime type for each area of Philly using the `crime_stats` CTE. Then, it calculates the weekly increase in crimes by percentage using the `crime_percent_change` and `weekly_increase` CTEs. Finally, the query selects all required columns for each area. 

The `LAG()` function is used in `crime_percent_change` CTE to get the previous week's crime count in order to calculate the current week's increase percentage. The `NULLIF()` function is used to handle the case where there were no crimes the previous week, which avoids division by zero errors.","SELECT Area_#,

**Explanation:**

1. **`CrimeCounts` CTE:**
   - Calculates the total crime count, last crime date, and reported crime type for each area.
   - `GROUP BY Area_#, Crime_Type` groups the data by area and crime type for aggregation.

2. **`WeekdayCrimeChange` CTE:**
   - Calculates the crime count for each day of the week (Sunday = 1, Saturday = 7) within each area.
   - This is required to calculate the weekly change percentage.

3. **Main `SELECT` Statement:**
   - Joins `CrimeCounts` and `WeekdayCrimeChange` to combine the data.
   - Selects the area number, total crime count, last crime date, reported crime type.
   - **Calculates Most Common Crime Type:**
     - Uses a subquery to find the most frequent crime type within each area based on count.
   - **Calculates Weekly Increase Percentage:**
     - Uses the `lag()` window function to get the crime count from the previous week.
     - Calculates the percentage increase using the formula:
       `(current_week_count - previous_week_count) / previous_week_count * 100`.

**Important Notes:**

- **Date Format:** Make sure the `Crime_Date` column in your table is in a consistent date format that SQL understands.
- **Weekly Trend:** This query assumes a Sunday-to-Saturday week. You might need to adjust the column reference `DayofWeek` or the logic if your week definition is different.



Let me know if you have any other SQL queries you'd like help with!","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific areas of Philly you're interested in. Could you provide me with the area IDs or names?","I will provide a SQL query to get most of the information you requested, except for the ""weekly increase in crimes by percentage"". This is because we don't have enough data to calculate a meaningful weekly increase. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    Area_#,
    COUNT(Crime_ID) AS total_crime_count,
    MAX(Crime_Date) AS last_reported_date,
    (SELECT Crime_Type FROM philly_crime_data WHERE Area_# = area_data.Area_# AND Crime_Date = area_data.last_reported_date LIMIT 1) AS last_crime_type,
    (SELECT Crime_Type FROM (
        SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) as crime_count
        FROM philly_crime_data
        WHERE Area_# = area_data.Area_#
        GROUP BY Crime_Type
        ORDER BY crime_count DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) as subquery) AS most_common_crime_type
FROM (
    SELECT Area_#, MAX(Crime_Date) AS last_reported_date
    FROM philly_crime_data
    GROUP BY Area_#
) as area_data
GROUP BY Area_#;
```

The query does the following:

1. Finds the most recent crime date and total crime count for each area by using the subquery `area_data`
2. Joins that information with the original table to get the last crime type for each area
3. Uses another subquery to find the most common crime type for each area",1,3.1949855020000086,0.3563636363636363,0.04585653455617426,"```sql

This SQL query uses several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to divide the work into manageable parts. It first calculates the crime count by week and assigns row numbers based on the recentness of the report. Then, it calculates the week-over-week percentage increase in the crime count using the LAG window function. It also determines the most common area for each crime type using the ROW_NUMBER() window function. Finally, the query groups data into the final output table and applies the first_value() window function to get the last reported area for each crime type. The output is sorted by Crime_Type.","SELECT

```","While I can help you structure the query, pulling the exact ""percentage increase by week"" requires more information and potentially the calculation to be performed outside the SQL query.  However, I can give you the foundation to calculate most of what you requested. 

Here's a SQL query to get most of the information you need:

```sql
WITH CrimeCounts AS (
    SELECT
        Crime_Type,
        COUNT(*) AS Total_Count,
        MAX(Date_Reported) AS Last_Reported_Date,
        MAX(Area_Name) AS Last_Reported_Area  
    FROM
        la_crime_data
    GROUP BY 
        Crime_Type
),
MostCommonAreas AS (
    SELECT
        Crime_Type,
        Area_Name,
        COUNT(*) AS Total_Instances
    FROM
        la_crime_data
    GROUP BY
        Crime_Type, Area_Name
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) = (SELECT MAX(COUNT(*)) FROM la_crime_data GROUP BY Crime_Type, Area_Name)
) 
SELECT 
    cc.Crime_Type,
    cc.Total_Count,
    cc.Last_Reported_Date,
    cc.Last_Reported_Area,
    mca.Area_Name AS MostCommonArea
FROM CrimeCounts cc
LEFT JOIN MostCommonAreas mca ON cc.Crime_Type = mca.Crime_Type;    
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`WITH` Clauses:**
   - **`CrimeCounts`:** Calculates the total count, last reported date, and last reported area for each crime type.
   - **`MostCommonAreas`:** Finds the most common area for each crime type by grouping by `Crime_Type` and `Area_Name`, and selecting the area with the maximum count for each `Crime_Type`.

2. **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
   - Joins the `CrimeCounts` and `MostCommonAreas` CTEs based on `Crime_Type`.
   - Retrieves the desired information: `Crime_Type`, total count, last reported date, last reported area, and the most common area.

**To calculate the weekly percentage increase, you'd need to:**

1. Group the data by week (using a function like `DATE_TRUNC('week', Date_Reported)`).
2. Calculate the difference in counts between consecutive weeks.
3. Divide the difference by the previous week's count to get the percentage change.  This is best done using tools outside of pure SQL (like Python or a data visualization tool) to handle the weekly groupings and calculations.","To fulfill the request, I'll need to join the `la_crime_data` table with itself to compare weekly counts. This will involve a self-join with a week-based filter. Let's start with the first part, which is to get the total count, last reported date, and last reported area for each crime type. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    Crime_Type,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Count,
    MAX(Date_Reported) AS Last_Reported_Date,
    MAX(Area_Name) AS Last_Reported_Area
FROM 
    la_crime_data
GROUP BY 
    Crime_Type;
```

This query will give us the total count, last reported date, and last reported area for each crime type. Once we have this, we can proceed with the self-join for the weekly comparison.","Here's an SQL query that fulfills the request. However, please note that this query might not be the most efficient one because it involves multiple subqueries and calculations. Also, it's assumed that the table has a column for the week of the crime report (e.g. extracting the week from the `Date_Reported` using a function such as `EXTRACT(WEEK FROM Date_Reported)` in PostgreSQL or `WEEKOFYEAR(Date_Reported)` in MySQL).

```sql
SELECT 
  Crime_Type,
  COUNT(*) AS total_count,
  MAX(Date_Reported) AS last_reported_date,
  Area_Name AS last_reported_area,
  (SELECT Area_Name 
   FROM la_crime_data 
   WHERE Crime_Type = cte.Crime_Type 
   GROUP BY Area_Name, Crime_Type 
   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 
   LIMIT 1) AS most_common_area,
  ROUND(100.0 * (SUM(CASE WHEN cte.this_week = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN cte.prev_week = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) / SUM(CASE WHEN cte.prev_week = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS pct_increase_by_week
FROM (
  SELECT 
    Crime_Type,
    Date_Reported,
    Area_Name,
    EXTRACT(WEEK FROM Date_Reported) AS this_week,
    EXTRACT(WEEK FROM DATE_SUB(Date_Reported, INTERVAL 7 DAY)) AS prev_week
  FROM la_crime_data
  WHERE Area_Name IS NOT NULL
) cte
GROUP BY Crime_Type
ORDER BY total_count DESC;
```

This query calculates the:

1. total count of each crime type
2. the date of the most recent crime report
3. the last reported area for each crime type
4. the most common area for each crime type
5. the percentage increase in each crime type by week

The subquery (cte) calculates the week number for each crime report, and the main query aggregates the results.

The percentage increase in each crime type by week is calculated as:
`(this_week - prev_week) / prev_week * 100`

Please adjust the week calculations based on the SQL variant you're using. The provided query may work with slight modifications in PostgreSQL and MySQL. For other SQL variants, you may need to use different functions or syntax for extracting the week and subtracting dates.",1,2.37064885399991,0.39662447257383965,0.02997393570807993,"```sql

Please note that calculating the percentage increase in the crime rate by week might be complicated because it requires having data for multiple weeks. In this SQL query, I'm assuming we have access to weekly data and will be using the 'LAG' function to get the previous week's data for comparison. If that's not your case, you might need to adjust the query or use a different strategy to calculate this.

This query performs several tasks:

1. Calculates the total crime count, last reported date, and last reported area for each crime type.
2. Constructs a percentage increase calculation using a window function (LAG), assuming weekly data.
3. Aggregates data in various ways to determine total counts per crime type, while the common area is determined by finding the area with the maximum count.
4. The final SELECT ensures we get the format of each crime type and their respective details even if there was no increase in crime or if there was no most common area (zero increase/no area with the highest count).","SELECT Crime_Type,

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**  
   - The query uses CTEs (`WeeklyCrimeCounts` and `LastReportedAreas`) to break down the complex logic into more manageable chunks. CTEs are temporary named result sets.

2. **`WeeklyCrimeCounts` CTE:**
   - Calculates the weekly crime counts for each crime type.
   - `DATE_TRUNC('week', Crime_Date)`  groups crimes by the start of the week (sunday).

3. **`LastReportedAreas` CTE:**
   - Finds the last reported date and area for each crime type.

4. **Main Query:**
   - Joins the `WeeklyCrimeCounts` and `LastReportedAreas` CTEs to combine the data.
   - Selects relevant columns, including the crime type, total count, last reported date, last reported area, and the most common area for each type.
   - **Note on Missing Week-by-Week Increase:**  Calculating the percentage increase by week requires more historical data. You'd need to track crime counts over multiple weeks for each crime type to make accurate comparisons.



**To use this query:**

- Replace `nyc_crime_data` with the actual name of your table.
- Execute the query in your SQL environment.  

**Remember**:

- This query assumes you have data spanning at least multiple weeks to accurately calculate week-by-week crime increases.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific crime type you're interested in. Could you specify the crime type you want to analyze?","To fulfill this request, we'll need to write a somewhat complex SQL query that involves multiple subqueries and aggregate functions. Here's a possible solution:

```sql
WITH total_crime_count AS (
  SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM nyc_crime_data
  WHERE Crime_Class = 'FELONY' AND Crime_Date <= CURDATE()
  GROUP BY Crime_Type
),
last_reported_date AS (
  SELECT Crime_Type, MAX(Crime_Date) AS last_reported_date
  FROM nyc_crime_data
  WHERE Crime_Class = 'FELONY'
  GROUP BY Crime_Type
),
last_reported_area AS (
  SELECT c1.Crime_Type, c1.Area_Name
  FROM nyc_crime_data c1
  JOIN (
    SELECT Crime_Type, MAX(Crime_Date) AS max_date
    FROM nyc_crime_data
    WHERE Crime_Class = 'FELONY'
    GROUP BY Crime_Type
  ) c2
  ON c1.Crime_Type = c2.Crime_Type AND c1.Crime_Date = c2.max_date
),
most_common_area AS (
  SELECT Crime_Type, Area_Name, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM nyc_crime_data
  WHERE Crime_Class = 'FELONY'
  GROUP BY Crime_Type, Area_Name
  ORDER BY total_count DESC
  LIMIT 1
),
weekly_crime_count AS (
  SELECT Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS weekly_count
  FROM nyc_crime_data
  WHERE Crime_Class = 'FELONY' AND Crime_Date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  GROUP BY Crime_Type
)
SELECT
  t.Crime_Type,
  t.total_count,
  ld.last_reported_date,
  la.Area_Name AS last_reported_area,
  mca.Area_Name AS most_common_area,
  ROUND(100.0 * (wc.weekly_count - tc.total_count) / tc.total_count, 2) AS percentage_increase
FROM
  total_crime_count t
  JOIN last_reported_date ld ON t.Crime_Type = ld.Crime_Type
  JOIN last_reported_area la ON t.Crime_Type = la.Crime_Type
  JOIN most_common_area mca ON t.Crime_Type = mca.Crime_Type
  JOIN weekly_crime_count wc ON t.Crime_Type = wc.Crime_Type
  JOIN total_crime_count tc ON t.Crime_Type = tc.Crime_Type;
```

This query involves six common table expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into smaller pieces:

1. `total_crime_count` calculates the total count of each crime type.
2. `last_reported_date` finds the last reported date for each crime type.
3. `last_reported_area` finds the area where each crime type was last reported.
4. `most_common_area` finds the most common area for each crime type.
5. `weekly_crime_count` counts the number of crimes reported for each crime type in the last week.
6. The final `SELECT` statement joins these CTEs together to get the desired output.

Note that this query uses MySQL syntax and assumes that the `Crime_Date` column is stored as a date type. You may need to adjust the query slightly depending on the specific SQL dialect and table schema you are working with.",1,2.1748819429999457,0.5590551181102362,0.08487950522499467,"```sql

```

This SQL query starts by creating three Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `crime_summary`, `common_area`, and `percent_increase`.

- In the `crime_summary` CTE, we select the crime type, count the total number of crimes for each type, and determine the maximum (latest) crime date and area number (for the last reported area).
- In the `common_area` CTE, we rank the areas by the number of crimes for each type, using the `RANK()` window function. Then, we filter for the top-ranked area, which is the most common area for each crime type.
- In the `percent_increase` CTE, we calculate the percentage increase in crime occurrences by week using the `EXTRACT()` function and the formula `(MAX(WEEK) - MIN(WEEK)) / MIN(WEEK) * 100`.

Finally, we select the data from the three CTEs, joining them by the `Crime_Type` column. We also handle cases where the percentage increase might be missing by applying the `COALESCE()` function, which replaces null values with zero.","SELECT

```","It's challenging to provide a precise SQL query to fulfill this request without knowing the exact implementations of your database and how ""most common area"" is defined. 

However, I can give you a structured query that addresses most of the points and you can modify it based on your specific requirements and table structure. 

```sql
WITH CrimeSummary AS (
    SELECT 
        Crime_Type,
        COUNT(Crime_ID) AS Total_Count,
        MAX(Crime_Date) AS Last_Reported_Date,

    FROM philly_crime_data

AreaFrequency AS (
    SELECT 
        Crime_Type,
        Area_#,
        COUNT(*) AS Occurrence_Count

    GROUP BY Crime_Type, Area_#
)
SELECT 
    CS.Crime_Type,
    CS.Total_Count,
    CS.Last_Reported_Date,
    CS.Last_Reported_Area,
    (
        SELECT Area_# 
        FROM AreaFrequency
        WHERE Crime_Type = CS.Crime_Type
        ORDER BY Occurrence_Count DESC 
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS Most_Common_Area  
FROM CrimeSummary CS;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **CrimeSummary CTE:**
   - Calculates the total count, last reported date, and last reported area for each crime type.

2. **AreaFrequency CTE:**
   - Calculates the occurrence count of each crime type in each area.

3. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - Combines the `CrimeSummary` and `AreaFrequency` results to get the requested information.
   - Uses a subquery to find the most common area for each crime type (based on highest occurrence count).

**To calculate the percentage increase in crime type by week, you will need:**

- **A Week Column:** Add a column to `philly_crime_data` that represents the week of the year for each report. This might involve date manipulation using functions like `DATE_TRUNC('week', Crime_Date)`.
- **Group By Week:** Modify the query to group by the week column.
- **Difference Calculation:** Use comparison functions (e.g., `LAG()`, `LEAD()`) or window functions to calculate the percentage change in crime count between weeks.

Remember to adapt this query to your specific database schema and data format.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to understand the specific crime types you're interested in. Could you specify which crime types you want to analyze?","To write the SQL query to fulfill the given natural language request, we will need to use various SQL functions such as COUNT, MAX, GROUP BY, and JOIN to get the desired information. Here's the query to get the total count, last reported date, last reported area, and most common area for each crime type in Philly:

```sql
SELECT Crime_Type,
       COUNT(*) AS Total_Count,
       MAX(Crime_Date) AS Last_Reported_Date,
       MAX(Area_#) AS Last_Reported_Area,
       (SELECT Area_#
        FROM philly_crime_data 
        WHERE Crime_Type = t.Crime_Type
        GROUP BY Area_#
        ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        LIMIT 1) AS Most_Common_Area
FROM philly_crime_data t
GROUP BY Crime_Type;
```

However, calculating the percentage increase in this crime type by week would be much more complicated, as it would require comparing the count of crimes for each type for a specific week with the count for the previous week. Unfortunately, the given table does not include information on weeks or any column to join with a date table. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an SQL query to calculate the percentage increase in this crime type by week with the provided schema.

To calculate the percentage increase in crime types by week, you would need to have a date table with week information (e.g., a separate table with a column for the date of the crime or a timestamp column with date and time information in the same table). Then, you could join the two tables using the date or timestamp information to get the week information and calculate the percentage increase.",1,2.2729154270000436,0.5407725321888412,0.0543870830677714,"```sql

This query selects the `Crime_Type`, extracts the `Month` and `Year` from the `Crime_Date`, counts the number of occurrences for each combination of `Crime_Type`, `Month`, and `Year`, and filters the rows where the `Area_Name` is 'Los Angeles'. The result is grouped by `Crime_Type`, `Month`, and `Year`, and ordered by `Year` and `Month`.","SELECT

This query will:

1. **Extract the year and month from the `Crime_Date` column** using the `strftime()` function and format it as `YYYY-MM`. We alias this as `Crime_Month`.
2. **Group the results** by `Crime_Month` and `Crime_Type`.
3. **Count the number of crimes** for each group using `COUNT(*)` and alias it as `Crime_Count`.
4. **Order the results** by `Crime_Month` and then `Crime_Type`. 



Let me know if you have any other SQL requests!","To fulfill your request, I'll need to know the specific months you're interested in. Could you provide those?","To get the count of each crime type for each month in LA, you can use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(Crime_Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
  Crime_Type, 
  COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM 
  la_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'LA'
GROUP BY 
  Month, 
  Crime_Type;
```
This query extracts the month and year from the `Crime_Date` column using the `DATE_FORMAT` function, and then groups the data by month and crime type. The `COUNT` function is used to get the count of records for each group. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the data for LA only.

Please note that I made the assumption that the `Area_Name` field contains the value 'LA' for crimes that occurred in Los Angeles. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the `WHERE` clause to correctly filter the data for Los Angeles.

Here is an example of the output you can expect from this query:

| Month | Crime\_Type | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-08 | BURGLARY FROM VEHICLE | 1 |
| 2020-08 | THEFT OF IDENTITY | 1 |
| 2020-09 | BURGLARY FROM VEHICLE | 1 |
| 2020-11 | BIKE - STOLEN | 1 |
| 2020-10 | SHOPLIFTING-GRAND THEFT ($950.01 & OVER) | 1 |

This query extracts the hour of the day from the `Crime_Time` column and groups the records by `Crime_Type` and `Hour_of_Day`.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT strftime('%H', Crime_Time) AS Hour, Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount`**: 
   - Selects the hour extracted from `Crime_Time` using `strftime('%H')` and aliases it as `Hour`.
   - Selects the `Crime_Type`.
   - Counts the number of occurrences for each combination of `Hour` and `Crime_Type` using `COUNT(*)` and aliases it as `CrimeCount`.

2. **`FROM la_crime_data`**: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **`WHERE LEFT(Area_Name, 2) = 'LA'`**: Filters the data to include only crimes where the `Area_Name` starts with 'LA', assuming this indicates crimes in Los Angeles.

4. **`GROUP BY Hour, Crime_Type`**: Groups the results by `Hour` and `Crime_Type` to count crimes for each unique combination.

5. **`ORDER BY Hour, Crime_Type`**: Orders the results first by hour and then alphabetically by crime type for better readability.

FROM 
  la_crime_data
WHERE 
  Area_Name = 'LA'
GROUP BY 
  DayOfWeek, Crime_Type
ORDER BY 
  DayOfWeek, Crime_Type;
```

This query does the following:
1. Filters the data by the 'Area_Name' to be equal to 'LA'.
2. Uses the `DAYNAME()` function to extract the day of the week from the 'Crime_Date'.
3. Groups the data by 'DayOfWeek' and 'Crime_Type', which allows us to count the occurrences of each crime type for each day of the week.
4. Uses the `COUNT(*)` function to calculate the number of crimes for each group.
5. Orders the results by 'DayOfWeek' and 'Crime_Type' to maintain a consistent and readable format.","SELECT

GROUP BY 
    DayOfWeek, Crime_Type
ORDER BY

```

**Explanation:**

* **`strftime('%w', Crime_Date) AS DayOfWeek`**: This extracts the day of the week as a number (0-6) from the `Crime_Date` column using the `strftime()` function.
* **`Crime_Type, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount`**: This groups the results by `DayOfWeek` and `Crime_Type` and counts the number of crimes for each combination, aliasing the count as `CrimeCount`.
* **`GROUP BY DayOfWeek, Crime_Type`**: This groups the results by day of the week and crime type.
* **`ORDER BY DayOfWeek, Crime_Type`**:  This orders the results first by day of the week and then by crime type.


This query will give you a count of each crime type for each day of the week in LA.","To fulfill the request, I'll need to aggregate the crime data by day of the week. Could you specify the date range for the analysis?","Here is an SQL query to get the count of each crime type for each day of the week in LA:

  DATE_PART('day', Date_Reported), 
  DATE_PART('dow', Date_Reported), 
  Crime_Type
ORDER BY 
  DATE_PART('day', Date_Reported), 
  Crime_Type;
```
This query uses the `DATE_PART` function to extract the day of the week (`dow`) and the day of the month (`day`) from the `Date_Reported` column. It then groups the results by these values, as well as the `Crime_Type` column, and counts the number of rows in each group.

Note that the `Area_Name` column is used to filter the results to only include crimes reported in LA. You may need to modify this query if the schema of the `la_crime_data` table is different than what was provided.

**Explanation:**

1. **JOIN:** Merges the `us_population` and `us_shootings` tables based on the common column `State`.
2. **SUM(us_shootings.SuspectsArrested):** Calculates the total number of suspects arrested from the `us_shootings` table for each state.
3. **us_population.PopulationCount:** Fetches the population count for each state from the `us_population` table.
4. **Division and Multiplication:** 
   - Divides the sum of suspects arrested by the population count to get the rate per capita.
   - Multiplies by 1000000 to express the rate as suspects arrested per million capita.
5. **GROUP BY us_population.State:** Groups the results by state to calculate the total suspects per million capita for each state.
6. **ORDER BY TotalSuspectsArrestedPerMillion DESC:** Sorts the results in descending order based on the calculated `TotalSuspectsArrestedPerMillion` value.



Please note: 

*  This query assumes your data is accurate and that every incident in `us_shootings` has a corresponding state in `us_population`. 
* You may need to adjust the query based on the specific structure and data types of your tables.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to join the `us_population` table with the `us_shootings` table on the `State` column. Then, I'll calculate the total suspects arrested per million capita for each state. Could you specify the year for the population data you want to use?","To fulfill this request, we'll first need to get the total number of suspects arrested for each state from the `us_shootings` table, then divide that by the population count for each state from the `us_population` table, and finally multiply the result by a million to get the total suspects arrested per million capita.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:
```
SELECT 
  s.State,
  (SUM(s.SuspectsArrested) / p.PopulationCount) * 1000000 AS 'Suspects Arrested per Million Capita'
FROM 
  us_shootings s
JOIN 
  us_population p ON s.State = p.State
GROUP BY 
  s.State;
```
This query performs the following steps:

1. Joins the `us_shootings` table (aliased as `s`) with the `us_population` table (aliased as `p`) on the `State` column of each table. This allows us to combine information about the number of suspects arrested with information about the population count for each state.

2. Groups the result set by the `State` column.

3. For each state, calculates the total number of suspects arrested by summing the `SuspectsArrested` column for each row with the same `State` value.

Let's call the new table USSN SHOOTING INCIDENTS (Incident_Year, LOCATION, Incident_Count):

```sql
SELECT 
  e.CALENDAR_YEAR AS Year,
  e.LOCATION AS Location,
  e.EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS_CNT AS Homeless_Population,

LEFT JOIN USSN_SHOOTING_INCIDENTS s
  ON e.CALENDAR_YEAR = s.Incident_Year AND e.LOCATION = s.LOCATION
ORDER BY

```

This query joins the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table (aliased as `e`) with the `USSN_SHOOTING_INCIDENTS` table (aliased as `s`). The join is made on both `CALENDAR_YEAR` and `LOCATION` to merge the data for each year and location. The left join ensures that all information from `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` is displayed even if there are no shooting incidents reported for a given year and location. Finally, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the year in ascending order.

Please note that the above query assumes that there is a similar `USSSN_SHOOTING_INCIDENTS` table available with the mentioned schema. If a different table schema for shooting incidents is used, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `ehd.CALENDAR_YEAR`: Selects the year from the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table.
   - `COUNT(ehd.EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS_CNT) AS homeless_count`: Counts the number of homeless individuals for each year.
   - `si.shooting_count`: Counts the number of shooting incidents for each year. **You need to replace `si.shooting_count` with the actual column name from your shooting incidents table.**

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics ehd`: Specifies the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table with the alias `ehd`.

3. **JOIN Clause:**
   - `JOIN shooting_incidents si`: Joins the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table with the `shooting_incidents` table (**replace with your actual table name**). 
   - `ON ehd.CALENDAR_YEAR = si.CALENDAR_YEAR`: Specifies the join condition based on the common column `CALENDAR_YEAR`.

4. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - `ehd.CALENDAR_YEAR`: Groups the results by year.

5. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   - `ehd.CALENDAR_YEAR`: Orders the results chronologically by year.


Make sure to replace `shooting_incidents` with the actual name of your shooting incidents table and adjust the join condition if necessary. Also, ensure that both tables have a `CALENDAR_YEAR` column for the join to work correctly.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to combine data from two tables.

1. Connect the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` and `us_population_county` tables using a JOIN clause on the county field.
2. Filter the results to only include rows where the `CALENDAR_YEAR` field is 2017.
3. Group the results by `LOCATION`, `CALENDAR_YEAR`, and `PopulationCount` to get the total homeless count and population count per county for 2017.
4. Calculate the per capita homeless population using the formula HomelessPopulation / TotalPopulation * 100.
5. Select all these columns to get the required data.

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT` Clause:** This defines the columns we want to retrieve:
   - `ehd.LOCATION AS County`:  We select the county name from the  `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table and rename it as `County`.
   - `ehd.EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS_CNT AS HomelessPopulation`: We select the homeless population count and rename it.
   - `upc.PopulationCount AS TotalPopulation`: We select the total population from the `us_population_county` table and rename it.
   - `(ehd.EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS_CNT / upc.PopulationCount) * 1000 AS HomelessPerCapita`:  We calculate the homeless population per capita by dividing the homeless population by the total population and multiplying by 1000 to represent it as ""per 1000"".

2. **`FROM` Clause:** We specify the tables we're using:
   - `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics ehd`:  We alias the table as `ehd` for brevity.
   - `JOIN us_population_county upc ON ehd.LOCATION = upc.County`: We perform a `JOIN` operation to combine data from both tables based on the matching `LOCATION` (county) column.

3. **`WHERE` Clause:**
   - `ehd.CALENDAR_YEAR = 2017`: We filter the data to include only records from the year 2017.

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query uses CTEs to break down the calculation into manageable steps:
   - **`HomelessPopulation` CTE:** Calculates the total homeless population for each county in 2017.
   - **`PopulationPerCounty` CTE:** Retrieves county population data.
   - **`ShootingsPerCounty` CTE:** Counts the total number of shooting incidents for each county.
2. **Join Operations:** The main query joins the three CTEs based on the `County` column to combine the data.
3. **Per Capita and Per Million Capita Calculations:**
   - `HomelessPerCapita` is calculated by dividing the `TotalHomeless` count by the `PopulationCount` and multiplying by 100,000 to express it as per capita.
   - `ShootingsPerMillionCapita` is calculated by dividing the `TotalShootings` count by the `PopulationCount`, multiplying by 1,000,000 to express it as per million capita.
4. **Ordering:** The results are ordered by `County` for readability.

**Assumptions:**

- The `us_population_county` table provides the most recent population data available.
- The `us_shootings` table includes all shooting incidents in the US, though it only shows a limited sample in your provided data.  You'll need to ensure it covers the desired timeframe for accurate per capita calculations.
- The accuracy of the results depends on the completeness and accuracy of the input data.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to combine data from two tables: `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` and `us_shootings`. Could you specify the years you're interested in for the homelessness data?","To fulfill this request, we'll need to write a SQL query that joins multiple tables and performs some calculations to get the required results. Here's the SQL query that will do that:

```
Let me explain how this query works.

1. The first common table expression (CTE) `homeless_population_per_capita` calculates the homeless population per capita for each county in California. It joins the `experiencing_homelessness_age_demographics` table with the `us_population_county` table on the `LOCATION` and `County` columns, respectively. It filters the data for the year 2017 and the 'Total' age group, then calculates the homeless population per capita by dividing the number of homeless people by the county population.
2. The second CTE `shooting_incidents_per_million_capita` calculates the number of shooting incidents per million capita for each county in California. It joins the `us_shootings` table with the `us_population_county` table on the `Address` and `County` columns, respectively. It filters the data for incidents that occurred between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, then calculates the number of shooting incidents per million capita by dividing the sum of victims killed and injured by the county population and multiplying by 1,000,000.
3. The final `SELECT` statement joins the two CTEs on the `LOCATION`, `CityOrCountry`, and `State` columns, respectively. It returns the homeless population per capita and shooting incidents per million capita for each county in California.

Note: This query assumes that the `Address` column in the `us_shootings` table contains the name of the county where the incident occurred. The query calculates the number of shooting incidents per million capita by adding the number of victims killed and injured, assuming that each incident results in at least one victim. You may need to adjust the query if your data is different.",1,4.38808969899992,0.3873517786561265,0.09584664536741214,"```sql

FROM
    shootings_per_capita
LEFT JOIN
    income_loss_income ON shootings_per_capita.County = income_loss_income.County
```

This query first creates a CTE named `shootings_per_county`, which joins the `us_population_county` and `us_shootings` tables and calculates the total number of shootings in each county. Then, another CTE named `shootings_per_capita` is created to calculate the number of shooting per million capita by dividing the total number of shootings by the total population of each county and multiplying the result by one million.

A third CTE named `income_loss_income` is created to calculate the income per million capita in each county by simply selecting the `MedianFamilyIncome` column from the `us_population_county` table and multiplying it by one million. 

Finally, the main SELECT statement joins the two CTEs together using a LEFT JOIN on the County column and returns the results with the names of the counties, shooting incidents per million capita, and income per million capita. The COALESCE function is used to return a zero value when the results of the calculations are NULL (in case a county does not exist in the `income_loss_income` table and there is no income data available. 

Please note that this query does not calculate income per capita for people that would have been in poverty. If it is important to capture that information, you can modify the `income_loss_income` CTE to accommodate your specific needs. Additionally, the above query assumes that the MedianFamilyIncome column is available in the us_population_county table. If it is labeled differently, please adjust the SQL query accordingly.","SELECT c.County,

OR","To fulfill your request, I'll need to join the us_population_county and us_shootings tables. Could you specify the columns you're interested in from these tables?","Here's an SQL query that should fulfill your request. Please note that since the schema does not have a clear relationship between the ""us\_shootings"" and ""food\_access"" tables (the two tables required for your request), I am assuming that the shooting incidents are evenly distributed across the county. This might not be the case in reality, but the query below will give you an estimation of shooting incidents per million capita and income per million capita for each county using the given schema and assumption.

```sql
WITH shooting_count_per_county AS (
  SELECT 
    County,
    COUNT(*) * 1000000.0 / (SELECT SUM(Pop2010) FROM food_access WHERE County = county_summary.County) AS shooting_incidents_per_million 
  FROM 
    us_shootings 
    JOIN food_access ON us_shootings.State = food_access.State 
  GROUP BY 
    County
),
income_per_county AS (
  SELECT 
    County,
    AVG(MedianFamilyIncome) * 1000000.0 / (SELECT SUM(Pop2010) FROM food_access WHERE County = county_summary.County) AS income_per_million
  FROM 
    food_access
  GROUP BY 
    County
)
SELECT 
  county_summary.County,
  shooting_summary.shooting_incidents_per_million,
  county_summary.income_per_million
FROM 
  (SELECT 
    County,
    SUM(Pop2010) AS total_population
  FROM 
    food_access
  GROUP BY 
    County) AS county_summary
  JOIN shooting_count_per_county AS shooting_summary ON county_summary.County = shooting_summary.County
  JOIN income_per_county AS income_summary ON county_summary.County = income_summary.County;
```

The query above first calculates the number of shooting incidents and the average income per capita for each county. It then aggregates this data by county, combining it with the total population of each county. This yields the desired results: shooting incidents per million capita and income per million capita for each county.",1,4.970737113000041,0.24277456647398846,0.1404833836858006,"```sql

 **Explanation:**

This query joins the `StatePopulation` and `StateShootingIncidents` CTEs together on `State` to link each state with its demographics and shooting incidents, calculates the shootings per thousand capita, and the median family income. 

**Points to Note:**

* **Data Cleaning:** You might need to perform additional data cleaning on the `us_shootings` table to handle any inconsistencies in the data. For this query to work accurately.
* **Missing Values:** Address missing

Let me know if you have any other questions.","To generate the SQL query for your request, I'll need to know the specific states you're interested in. Could you provide me with the list of states?","To answer this request, you would need to first calculate the number of shooting incidents per million population for each state, and then calculate the median family income per million for each state. Here's how you could write the SQL query to do this:
```
SELECT
  us_population.State,
  COUNT(us_shootings.IncidentID) * 1000000.0 / us_population.PopulationCount AS ShootingIncidentsPerMillion,
  MedianFamilyIncome * 1000000.0 / us_population.PopulationCount AS IncomePerMillion
FROM
  us_population
JOIN
  us_shootings
ON
  us_population.State = us_shootings.State
JOIN
  food_access
ON
  us_shootings.State = food_access.State
GROUP BY
  us_population.State, us_population.PopulationCount, food_access.MedianFamilyIncome;
```
This query joins the `us_population`, `us_shootings`, and `food_access` tables on the `State` column, and then calculates the number of shooting incidents per million population for each state by dividing the count of `IncidentID` values for each state by the population count of that state, and then multiplying that result by 1,000,000. It does the same for the median family income for each state by dividing the `MedianFamilyIncome` value for each state by the population count of that state, and then multiplying that result by 1,000,000.

Note that I am assuming that the `MedianFamilyIncome` column in the `food_access` table contains the median family income for each state. If that is not the case, you would need to modify the query to use the appropriate table and column for the median family income.

Also, this query will give you the shooting incidents and income per million capita for each state, but it will not give you the results for each state in alphabetical order. If you want to sort the results by state in alphabetical order, you can add the following line at the end of the query:
```
ORDER BY us_population.State;
```
Finally, if you only want to see the results for a specific set of states, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query to filter the results to those states. For example, if you only want to see the results for the states of Alabama, Alaska, and American Samoa, you can add the following `WHERE` clause to the query:
```
WHERE us_population.State IN ('alabama', 'alaska', 'american samoa');
```
This will filter the results to only include rows where the `State` column has one of the values `'alabama'`, `'alaska'`, or `'american samoa'`.",1,3.7304417599998487,0.3756906077348066,0.13564213564213565,"```sql

```

This query joins the `us_shootings` table with the `us_population_county` table on the `CityOrCountry` and `County` columns, respectively. It then groups the results by the county (`p.County`) and calculates the following metrics per million capita:

- Victims killed per million capita (ROUND(SUM(u.VictimsKilled) * 1000000 / p.PopulationCount, 2)).
- Victims injured per million capita (ROUND(SUM(u.VictimsInjured) * 1000000 / p.PopulationCount, 2)).

- Incident counts per million capita (ROUND(COUNT(u.IncidentID) * 1000000 / p.PopulationCount, 2)).

The result is ordered in descending order of each metric.

To ensure this query works properly, please check that the `CityOrCountry` column of the `us_shootings` table matches the `County` column of the `us_population_county` table accurately, as the join condition is based on this match.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause:** We select the following columns:
   - `c.County`: The county name.
   - `VictimsKilledPerMillion`, `VictimsInjuredPerMillion`, `SuspectsArrestedPerMillion`, `IncidentCountPerMillion`: Calculated metrics.

2. **FROM Clause:** 
   - We join the `us_shootings` table (`us_s`) with the `us_population_county` table (`p`) based on matching state names.

3. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - We group the results by county (`c.County`) to calculate the aggregated metrics per county.

4. **Calculations:**

   - `CAST(SUM(us_s.VictimsKilled) AS REAL) * 1000000 / p.PopulationCount`: Calculates victims killed per million capita.
   - Similar calculations are done for `VictimsInjured`, `SuspectsArrested`, and `IncidentID`.
   - `CAST( ... AS REAL)` ensures that the division results in decimal values.

5. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   - We order the final result by county name for readability.


This query joins the two tables, calculates the requested metrics per county, and then presents the results in a clear and organized manner.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to know the name of the table where the population data is stored. Could you provide that?","Here is a possible SQL query to fulfill your request:
```
SELECT 
  County, 
  (SUM(VictimsKilled) / PopulationCount / 1000000) AS VictimsKilledPerMillion,
  (SUM(VictimsInjured) / PopulationCount / 1000000) AS VictimsInjuredPerMillion,
  (SUM(SuspectsArrested) / PopulationCount / 1000000) AS SuspectsArrestedPerMillion,

FROM us_shootings
JOIN us_population_county
ON us_shootings.State = us_population_county.County
GROUP BY County
ORDER BY IncidentCountPerMillion DESC;
```
This query first calculates the sum of victims killed, victims injured, and suspects arrested for each county, then divides these sums by the county's population to get the victims killed, victims injured, and suspects arrested per million capita. It also calculates the incident count by dividing the number of incidents in each county by the total number of incidents. The result is then ordered by the incident count per million capita in descending order.

Note that the join condition in this query is using the `State` column in the `us_shootings` table and the `County` column in the `us_population_county` table. This is because the county names may not match exactly between the two tables, and it is assumed that the county names in the `us_shootings` table are actually the state abbreviations followed by the county names. If this is not the case, the join condition will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Also note that the population counts in the `us_population_county` table are used as the denominator for all the per million capita calculations. If you want to use the total population of the United States instead, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.",1,1.972077813999931,0.39393939393939387,0.12570006222775357,"```sql

```

This query joins the `us_population` and `us_shootings` tables on the `State` column, and filters the data to include populations from the year 2010. The data is then grouped by `State` and `PopulationCount`, and the number of shootings and the shootings per million capita are calculated and selected for each state. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order of the number of shootings per million capita.","To get the shooting incidents per million capita for each state, you should first calculate the total population for each state by summing up the population counts from the us_population table. Then, join this data with the us_shootings table to get the count of shooting incidents. Finally, calculate the incidents per million capita by dividing the shooting incidents count by the total state population, and then multiplying the result by 1,000,000 to convert it to a per million scale.

```
This query uses a LEFT JOIN to compensate for states that might have no recorded shootings.

**Explanation:**

1. **JOIN:**  We join the `us_shootings` and `us_population` tables based on the `State` column and ensure we're using the 2010 census data (`CensurYear = 2010`).
2. **COUNT(us_shoot.IncidentID):** This counts the total number of shooting incidents for each state.
3. **ShootingIncidentsPerMillion:** This calculates the shooting incidents per million capita by:
   - Dividing the total shooting incidents by the state population.
   - Multiplying the result by 1,000,000 to express it as incidents per million. 
4. **GROUP BY us_pop.State:** This groups the results by state, allowing us to calculate the metrics for each state individually.
5. **ORDER BY us_pop.State:** This sorts the results alphabetically by state.



This query will give you the desired information about shooting incidents per million capita for each state in the provided schema and dataset.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to join the `us_population` table with the `us_shootings` table on the `State` column.

```
This query joins the `us_population` and `us_shootings` tables on the `State` column and calculates the number of shooting incidents per million capita for each state. The result is then grouped by state and sorted in descending order by the number of incidents per million.

Note that the formula for calculating the number of incidents per million capita is:
```
(us_shootings.VictimsKilled + us_shootings.VictimsInjured) * 1000000.0 / us_population.PopulationCount
```
This formula adds the number of victims killed and injured in each shooting incident and multiplies the result by 1,000,000 to convert it to a rate per million people. This rate is then divided by the population count of each state to get the number of incidents per million capita.

2. It then joins two grouped subqueries, each one of them calculating the average house rent for pre-COVID (2019) and post-COVID (2022) periods for individual Atlanta zipcodes.
3. The final result displays the zipcode, the average rent for pre-COVID and post-COVID periods, and the difference (change) in average rent between the periods.","Given the schema of the table referencing a national zip code detail, we would modify the SQL query to reference the full basis of zcta5 codes that denote Atlanta, Georgia.

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT clause:**
    - `zipcode`: Selects the zipcode column.
    - `AVG(rent_value_max) AS avg_rent_2019`: Calculates the average of `rent_value_max` for the year 2019 and names it `avg_rent_2019`.
    - `AVG(rent_value_max) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode ORDER BY year ASC) AS avg_rent_2022`: This calculates the running average of `rent_value_max` for each `zipcode` ordered by year ascending. This effectively gives the average rent for each zipcode in 2022.

2. **FROM clause:**
    - `housing_rent`: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.

3. **WHERE clause:**
    - `year IN (2019, 2022)`: Filters the data to include only rows for the years 2019 and 2022.

4. **GROUP BY clause:**
    - `zipcode`: Groups the results by zipcode so that the average rents are calculated for each zipcode.

5. **ORDER BY clause:**
    - `zipcode`: Orders the final results by zipcode for better readability.




This query will give you the desired output: a list of Atlanta zipcodes with their average rent in 2019 and 2022, allowing you to see the change (increase or decrease) in average rent for each zipcode during the pre- and post-COVID periods.","To generate the SQL query, I need to know the specific zipcodes you're interested in for Atlanta. Could you provide those?","To get the change in average house rent from 2019 to 2022 for each zipcode in Atlanta, you can use the following SQL query:

FROM housing_rent
WHERE zipcode LIKE '300%' -- Atlanta zipcodes start with '300'
AND year IN (2019, 2022)

```

This query filters the data to only include rows from Atlanta (based on the assumption that Atlanta zipcodes start with '300'), and then calculates the average house rent for 2019 and 2022 for each zipcode. The change in average rent is calculated by subtracting the average rent from 2019 from the average rent from 2022 for each zipcode.

Note that the `housing_rent` table uses `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max` to represent the range of rent for a given year, id, and zipcode. To calculate the average rent, we can simply use `rent_value_max`, under the assumption that it represents the actual rent. If instead you would like to calculate the average rent based on the range of rent, you can use a different query:

```
SELECT zipcode, AVG(0.5 * (rent_value_min + rent_value_max)) AS change_in_average_rent
FROM housing_rent
WHERE zipcode LIKE '300%' -- Atlanta zipcodes start with '300'
AND year IN (2019, 2022)

```

This query calculates the average rent by taking the midpoint of the range of rent (i.e., the average of `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max`).",1,2.5965181880001182,0.48484848484848486,0.10512483574244415,"```sql

This query consists of multiple parts:
- The first and second subqueries (`r1` and `r2`) calculate the average house rent for the years 2017 and 2022 separately.
- The `JOIN` statement connects the two subqueries based on the `zipcode` column, ensuring that each zipcode in the output is present for both years.
- The final `SELECT` statement calculates the change in average house rent by subtracting the average rent in 2017 from the average rent in 2022 for each zipcode.

Note: This solution assumes that the `house_value_min` column can be used as an approximation of the average rent value in each zipcode. If more accurate rent values are available, you can adjust the query accordingly.","SELECT

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT**: We select the `zipcode` and calculate the average maximum house value for both 2017 and 2022. We use a window function `AVG(house_value_max) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode ORDER BY year ASC)` to calculate the running average of `house_value_max` for each `zipcode` over time.
2. **FROM**: We specify the table `housing_value`.
3. **WHERE**: The query filters for years 2017 and 2022.
4. **GROUP BY**: We group the results by `zipcode`.
5. **ORDER BY**: Finally, we order the results by `zipcode`.

**Note:**

* This query assumes that `house_value_max` represents the average rent for a zipcode.
* You may need to adjust the query depending on your specific schema and data.","To generate the SQL query for this request, I need to clarify a few details. Are we looking at the average house rent change for each zipcode in Georgia from 2017 to 2022?","In order to fulfill this request, we need to assume that the `house_value_max` column represents the maximum rent for a house in a zipcode for a given year. Also, we need to assume that there is only one entry for each zipcode and year in the `housing_value` table.

Here is the SQL query to get the change in average house rent from 2017 to 2022 for each zipcode in Georgia:
```
SELECT zipcode,
       AVG(house_value_max) - 
       (SELECT AVG(house_value_max) 
        FROM housing_value 
        WHERE housing_value.zipcode = housing_value_2017.zipcode AND year = 2017) 
       AS change_in_average_rent
FROM housing_value 
WHERE year = 2022 AND zipcode IN (SELECT zipcode FROM housing_value WHERE year = 2017 AND state = 'GA')
GROUP BY zipcode;
```
This query first filters the `housing_value` table to only include entries for the year 2022 and zipcodes that are present in Georgia in 2017. For each of these zipcodes, it calculates the average house rent in 2022 and subtracts the average house rent in 2017. The result is the change in average house rent for each zipcode from 2017 to 2022.

Note that this query assumes that the `state` column is present in the `housing_value` table and contains the two-letter state abbreviation for each entry. If this is not the case, the subquery that selects the zipcodes present in Georgia in 2017 will need to be modified accordingly.",1,4.184114614000009,0.40601503759398494,0.05363984674329502,"```sql

2. **`AVG(house_value_min + house_value_max) / 2 AS average_house_value`**:
   - Calculates the average house value for each year:
     - Adds `house_value_min` and `house_value_max` to get the range.
     - Averages the range to get a single average value. 

3. **`AVG(rent_value_min + rent_value_max) / 2 AS average_rent`**:
   - Does the same for average rent, using `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max`.

4. **`GROUP BY year`**:

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause**:  
    - `h_in.zipcode`: Selects the zip code.
    - `AVG(h_rent.rent_value_min)`: Calculates the average `rent_value_min` from the `housing_rent` table for each zip code.
    - `AVG(maintenance_cost)`: You'll need to replace this with the actual column name and calculation for maintenance cost from your `maintenance_cost` table.
2. **FROM Clause**: Begins with the `household_income_percent_without_mortgage` table (aliased as `h_in`).
3. **INNER JOIN Clause**: 
    - Joins `housing_rent` table (aliased as `h_rent`) with `household_income_percent_without_mortgage` on common columns (`id`, `year`, `zipcode`). This links rent information with household income data.
4. **WHERE Clause**:  Filters for households without a mortgage. You'll need to adjust this condition based on how your data identifies mortgage-free households (e.g., `income_percent_min=0`.
5. **GROUP BY Clause**: Groups the results by `zipcode` to calculate average rent and maintenance cost for each zip code.




Remember to replace `""maintenance_cost""` with the actual column name from your maintenance cost table and adjust the `WHERE` clause logic if your data structure is different.","To generate the SQL query, I need to understand the relationships between the tables. Could you specify how the tables are linked?","To fulfill the request, you can use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT zipcode, AVG( (rent_value_max + rent_value_min) / 2 ) AS average_rent, AVG( ( (income_percent_max + income_percent_min) / 2 ) * 0.01 * (rent_value_max + rent_value_min) / 2 ) AS average_maintenance_cost

JOIN housing_rent hr ON hipwm.zipcode = hr.zipcode AND hipwm.number_of_units = hr.number_of_units

```
This query joins the `household_income_percent_without_mortgage` and `housing_rent` tables on the `zipcode` and `number_of_units` columns, and then filters for households where the `income_percent_max` is 0 (indicating no mortgage). It then calculates the average rent by taking the average of the `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max` columns, and calculates the average maintenance cost by taking the average of the product of the `income_percent_min` and `income_percent_max` columns (representing the percentage of income spent on rent) and the `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max` columns (representing the actual rent). The result is grouped by `zipcode` to get the average rent and maintenance cost for each zip code.

Note: This query assumes that the `income_percent_min` and `income_percent_max` columns represent the percentage of income spent on rent for the minimum and maximum number of units, respectively.

2. **`FROM housing_rent INNER JOIN housing_value ON housing_rent.id = housing_value.id`**: This joins the `housing_rent` and `housing_value` tables based on the common column `id`. The `INNER JOIN` ensures that only rows with matching `id` values in both tables are included.
3. **`WHERE year = 2022`**: This filters the results to include only data from the year 2022.

GROUP BY 
    zipcode;
```
This query joins the `housing_value` and `housing_rent` tables on the `zipcode` and `year` columns, filters for the year 2022, and then groups the results by `zipcode`. For each group, it calculates the average house value by taking the average of the minimum and maximum house values, and does the same for the average rent value.

Note: In the `housing_value` and `housing_rent` tables, the `house_value_min`, `house_value_max`, `rent_value_min`, and `rent_value_max` columns appear to be the minimum and maximum values for a set of units, rather than individual units. To get a more accurate average, you may want to calculate the average of these values separately for each set of units before taking the average by zipcode.

Then we need to select the year, zipcode, marginalized communities' percentage, and average SMOCAPI for those years after 2016.

**Explanation:**

* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query uses CTEs to break down the calculation into smaller, more manageable steps. 
    * `marginalized_community_percentages`: Calculates the percentage of marginalized communities for each zipcode in each year after 2016.
    * `avg_smocapi_by_zipcode`: Calculates the average SMOCAPI for each zipcode in each year after 2016. You'll need to adjust the `AVG()` function based on how the SMOCAPI is represented in your `household_income_percent_with_mortgage` table.
* **JOIN:** The main query joins the two CTEs based on `year` and `zipcode` to combine the percentages with the average SMOCAPI.
* **ORDER BY:** The results are ordered by `year` and `zipcode` for better readability.

**Important Notes:**

* Replace the placeholder `-- You'll need to modify this...` comment with the actual calculation for the average SMOCAPI. This depends on how the SMOCAPI is stored in your `household_income_percent_with_mortgage` table.
* Make sure the column names and table structures in your database match the ones used in the query.

Next, it calculates the total population and marginalized communities (black, Asian, American Indian & Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian & Pacific Inlander) for each zipcode.

Finally, it groups the results by `zipcode` and calculates the average SMOCAPI and percentage of marginalized communities for each zipcode.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - `economic_income_and_benefits eib`: This specifies the `economic_income_and_benefits` table as the primary source of data and assigns it the alias `eib`.
   - `JOIN housing_value hv ON eib.zipcode = hv.zipcode`: This performs a `JOIN` operation between the `economic_income_and_benefits` table (`eib`) and the `housing_value` table (`hv`) based on the condition that the `zipcode` column values match in both tables. This ensures that data from both tables is combined for each zipcode.

3. **GROUP BY Clause:**

Here is the SQL query to get the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    eia.zipcode AS 'Zipcode',
    (h.units_with_mortgage::FLOAT / h.total_households::FLOAT) * 100 AS 'Percentage of units with mortgage',
    eia.median_household_income AS 'Median Household Income'
FROM economic_income_and_benefits AS eia
INNER JOIN housing_mortgage AS h
    ON eia.year = h.year AND eia.id = h.id
GROUP BY eia.zipcode
ORDER BY eia.zipcode;
```

This query first joins the `economic_income_and_benefits` (aliased as `eia`) and `housing_mortgage` (aliased as `h`) tables on the `year` and `id` columns to relate the data for each zipcode. 

Then, it calculates the percentage of units with mortgage by dividing the `units_with_mortgage` by the `total_households` and multiplying the result by 100. Next, the query selects the `median_household_income` from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table.

Finally, it groups the results by `zipcode` and orders the output by `zipcode`.

Note that the original table schema does not have a `total_households` column necessary to compute the percentage of units with mortgage. If the `total_households` value is instead the `total_households` from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table, you can modify the query as follows:

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause:**
   - `eib.zipcode`: Selects the zipcode from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table (aliased as `eib`).
   - `(hm.units_with_mortgage * 100.0 / (hm.units_with_mortgage + hm.units_without_mortgage)) AS mortgage_percentage`: Calculates the percentage of units with a mortgage using the formula: `(units_with_mortgage / total_units) * 100`
   - `eib.median_household_income`: Selects the median household income from the `economic_income_and_benefits` table.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - Joins the `economic_income_and_benefits` table (`eib`) with the `housing_mortgage` table (`hm`) on the conditions:
     - `eib.zipcode = hm.zipcode`: Matching zipcodes.
     - `eib.year = hm.year`: Matching years.

3. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - Groups the results by `eib.zipcode` and `eib.median_household_income` to get one row per zipcode and its corresponding median household income.","To generate the SQL query, I'll need to combine data from both tables.

This query calculates the percentage of units with mortgage by dividing the sum of `units_with_mortgage` by the sum of `units_with_mortgage` and `units_without_mortgage` for each zipcode. It also includes the `median_household_income` for each zipcode.

Note that I used the `NULLIF` function in the calculation to avoid division by zero error. If the denominator is zero, the result of the calculation will be null.

I assumed that the year column in both tables is the same and you want to join the data of the same year. If this is not the case, please let me know. Also, I joined the two tables based on the columns: year, id and zipcode.

**Explanation:**

* **SELECT Clause:** 
    * Selects `zipcode` along with the calculated percentages for 2017, 2022, and the percentage change.
* **Subqueries:**
    * Three subqueries are used for each percentage calculation:
        *  They select `SUM(no_health_insurance)` and `SUM(total_population)` for the specified year and zipcode.
        *  Then, they divide the sum of uninsured by the total population and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
* **Percentage Change Calculation:**
    *  Calculates the percentage change using the formula:
        * ((2022 percentage - 2017 percentage) / 2017 percentage) * 100
* **FROM Clause:**
    *  Specifies the table `economic_health_insurance` as `ehi` for brevity.
* **WHERE Clause:**
    *  Filters data for years 2017 and 2022 and for the state 'GA'.
* **GROUP BY Clause:**
    * Groups the results by `zipcode` to calculate percentages for each unique zipcode.
* **ORDER BY Clause:**
    * Orders the results alphabetically by `zipcode`. 



 Let me know if you have any other SQL queries you need help with!","To generate the SQL query, I need to know the specific years you're interested in for the population data. You mentioned 2017 and 2022, correct?","Here is the SQL query to find the change in percentage of population with no health insurance from year 2017 to 2022 for each zipcode of Georgia:
```
SELECT zipcode,
       (no_health_insurance_2022 - no_health_insurance_2017) * 100.0 / no_health_insurance_2017 AS change_in_percentage

WHERE subquery_2017.zipcode IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT zipcode
  FROM economic_health_insurance
  WHERE state = 'Georgia'
)
```
This query first selects the `zipcode` and the number of people without health insurance in 2017 and 2022 from the `economic_health_insurance` table, then calculates the change in percentage of population with no health insurance. The result is filtered to only include zipcodes that are in Georgia.

Note: This query assumes that there are records for each zipcode in the `economic_health_insurance` table for both the years 2017 and 2022. If there are zipcodes that are missing data for either of these years, then the query will not return results for those zipcodes.

Also, the query calculates the change in percentage as `(no_health_insurance_2022 - no_health_insurance_2017) * 100.0 / no_health_insurance_2017`. This formula calculates the change as a percentage of the 2017 population without health insurance. If you want to calculate the change as a percentage of the 2022 population without health insurance, then you can use the formula `(no_health_insurance_2022 - no_health_insurance_2017) * 100.0 / no_health_insurance_2022` instead.",1,1.775418590000072,0.45161290322580644,0.13186813186813187,"```sql

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression):** 
   - Defines a temporary named result set called `PublicTransportData`.
   - Calculates the percentage of workers commuting via public transport for each year (2017 and 2022) and zipcode.

2. **Main Query:**
   - Joins the `PublicTransportData` CTE twice, once for each year (ptd1 for 2017, ptd2 for 2022), based on matching zipcodes and years.
   - Uses a conditional to filter for Georgia zip codes (assuming they start with '30%').
   - Calculates the percentage change in public transport usage between 2017 and 2022 using the formula: `((ptd2.pct_public_transport - ptd1.pct_public_transport) / ptd1.pct_public_transport) * 100`.
   - Orders the results by zipcode for easy reading.

**Important Notes:**

- This query assumes that your `economic_commute_to_work` table has a `postcode` column indicating the zipcode. If it uses a different column name, adjust the query accordingly.
- The Georgia zip code prefix assumption (`30%`) might not be universal, so double-check your data.
- Make sure the years 2017 and 2022 are present in your table data.

   - `AVG(hv.house_value_min) AS average_housing_price`: Calculates the average of the minimum house value for each zipcode.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - `social_education_attainment se`: Joins the `social_education_attainment` table with the alias `se`.
   - `JOIN housing_value hv`: Joins the `housing_value` table with the alias `hv`.

3. **ON Clause:**
   - `se.zipcode = hv.zipcode`: Matches records based on zipcode.
   - `se.year = hv.year`: Matches records based on year (2022).
   - `se.state = 'Georgia'`: Filters for Georgia.

4. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   - `z.zipcode`: Groups the results by zipcode.

5. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   - `z.zipcode`: Orders the results alphabetically by zipcode.


**Important Notes:**

- Make sure to replace `'Georgia'` with the actual state abbreviation if needed.","To fulfill the request, I'll need to join the `social_education_attainment` and `housing_value` tables based on the zipcode.

```
This query first joins the `social_education_attainment` and `housing_value` tables on the `zipcode` and `year` columns. It then filters the results to only include rows from the year 2022 and the state of Georgia.

The query then calculates the percentage of the population with an associate degree or higher by summing the population of people with a bachelor's degree or higher and dividing it by the total population of people who are 25 years and older. This value is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Finally, the query groups the results by `zipcode` and calculates the average housing value using the `house_value_min` column from the `housing_value` table.

It's worth noting that the `house_value_min` column might not be the best column to use to calculate the average housing price, depending on the context and the data. You might want to consider using the `house_value_max` column or some other column that better represents the housing price.

**Explanation:**

1. **JOIN:** We JOIN the `housing_value` and `social_computer_internet_usage` tables on the common columns `year` and `zipcode`. This allows us to combine data for each year and zipcode.
2. **WHERE:** We filter the data to include only years after 2016.
3. **AVG(h.house_value_min):** Calculates the average minimum house value for each zipcode in each year.
4. **SUM(CASE...):** This creates a sum of 1 for each household with broadband subscription and 0 otherwise. We use `CASE WHEN` to check the value of `with_broadband_internet_subscription`.
5. **COUNT(DISTINCT s.id):** Counts the total number of distinct households in each zipcode for each year.
6. **CAST(... AS REAL) * 100 / ...:**  Divides the sum of broadband subscriptions by the total number of households and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage. We use `CAST` to convert the sum to a real number for accurate division.
7. **GROUP BY:**  Groups the results by `year` and `zipcode` to get the aggregated data for each zipcode in each year.
8. **ORDER BY:**  Orders the results by `year` and `zipcode`.



Let me know if you have any other SQL queries you'd like help with!","To fulfill the request, I'll need to join the housing_value and social_computer_internet_usage tables based on the zipcode. Here's the SQL query:

```sql

This query first joins the `housing_value` and `social_computer_internet_usage` tables on the `year` and `zipcode` columns, so that it can access data from both tables for each zip code and year. It then filters the results to only include records with a year greater than 2016.

Next, it calculates the average housing price for each zip code by taking the average of the `house_value_max` column. It also calculates the percentage of houses with broadband subscription for each zip code by dividing the sum of the `with_broadband_internet_subscription` column by the sum of the `total_households` column, and then multiplying the result by 100.

Finally, it groups the results by zip code so that it returns a separate result for each unique zip code.",1,1.996974646000126,0.676470588235294,0.12677878395860284,"```sql

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    hr.zipcode, 
    AVG(hr.rent_value_min + hr.rent_value_max) / 2 AS avg_housing_rent, 
    100 * SUM(if(sciui.with_broadband_internet_subscription != 0, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) AS percentage_broadband_subscription
FROM 
    housing_rent hr   
JOIN 
    social_computer_internet_usage sciui 
ON hr.year = sciui.year AND hr.zipcode = sciui.zipcode
WHERE 
    hr.year > 2016
GROUP BY 
    hr.zipcode;
```

Explanation:

1. The `FROM` clause joins the `housing_rent` table (`hr`) and the `social_computer_internet_usage` table (`sciui`) on the `year` and `zipcode` columns.
2. The `WHERE` clause filters the data for years after 2016.
3. The `SELECT` clause calculates the average housing rent per zipcode by adding the minimum and maximum rent values and dividing by 2. The `SUM` function in the `percentage_broadband_subscription` calculation counts the number of rows where there is a broadband subscription, and the `COUNT` function counts the total rows. Dividing the two numbers gives the percentage.
4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `zipcode`.
5. We use the `IF` function in the `SUM` to handle values where there is a broadband subscription by counting those rows as 1 and the others as 0.

Note that this query assumes the `rent_value_min` and `rent_value_max` columns are denoting the minimum and maximum rental values per unit for each house, and not the total values for all houses with those values. If the `with_broadband_internet_subscription` values in the `social_computer_internet_usage` table are equal to the number of houses that have a subscription within the total households, the above formula will be applied. If the data does not work this way, the formula should be adjusted accordingly according to the actual data distribution.","Here is the SQL code:

**Explanation:**

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**
   - `AverageRent`: Calculates the average monthly rent for each zip code and year after 2016 using the `AVG()` function.
   - `BroadbandPercentage`: Calculates the percentage of households with broadband internet subscriptions for each zip code and year after 2016. This is done by dividing the sum of `with_broadband_internet_subscription` by `total_households` and multiplying by 100.

2. **JOIN:**
   - The `SELECT` statement joins `AverageRent` and `BroadbandPercentage` CTEs using their common columns (`year` and `zipcode`).

3. **Final Output:**
   - The query returns the year, zip code, average rent, and broadband percentage for each combination.
   - The results are ordered by year and then by zip code.
